Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images. We took care to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43] ) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

We did not collect segmentations for the following 11 categories: hat, shoe, eyeglasses (too many instances), mirror, window, door, street sign (ambiguous and difficult to label), plate, desk (due to confusion with bowl and dining table, respectively) and blender, hair brush (too few instances). We may add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1

Extract into a markdown table the data characteristics of the datasets present in the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

These include ImageNet [1] , PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] , and SUN [3] . Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images. ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

The 2014 release contains 82,783 training, 40,504 validation, and 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test). There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Note that we have limited the 2014 release to a subset of 80 categories. We did not collect segmentations for the following 11 categories: hat, shoe, eyeglasses (too many instances), mirror, window, door, street sign (ambiguous and difficult to label), plate, desk (due to confusion with bowl and dining table, respectively) and blender, hair brush (too few instances). We may add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

- Dataset: Not specified 
- Characteristics:
    - Goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding.
    - Images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context
    - Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization
    - Contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old
    - 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images
    - Involved extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting, and instance segmentation
    - Detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN 
    - Baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

- Dataset: Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO)
- Characteristics:
    - Compared to several other popular datasets: ImageNet, PASCAL VOC 2012, and SUN
    - Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images
    - ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained
    - SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them
    - PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images
    - MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Number of instances per category for all 91 categories is shown in Fig. 5(a)
    - Summary of the datasets showing the number of object categories and the number of instances per category is shown in Fig. 5(d)
    - MS COCO has fewer categories than ImageNet and SUN, but has more instances per category which can be useful for learning complex models capable of precise localization.
    - In comparison to PASCAL VOC, MS COCO has both more categories and instances.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context
    - The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image.
    - For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled.
    - On average MS COCO dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image
    - In comparison, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average
    - Only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC.
    - SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

- Dataset: MS COCO and SUN
- Characteristics:
    - Analyze the average size of objects in the datasets
    - Generally smaller objects are harder to recognize and require more contextual reasoning to recognize
    - As shown in Fig. 5(e), the average sizes of objects is smaller for both MS COCO and SUN

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Split into two roughly equal parts:
        - First half of the dataset was released in 2014
        - Second half will be released in 2015
    - 2014 release contains:
        - 82,783 training images
        - 40,504 validation images
        - 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test)
        - Nearly 270k segmented people 
        - Total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone
    - 2015 release will contain:
        - 165,482 training images
        - 81,208 validation images
        - 81,434 testing images
    - Care was taken to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43]) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

- Dataset: Not specified
- Characteristics:
    - Following established protocol, annotations for train and validation data will be released, but not for test
    - Evaluation server for automatic evaluation on the test set is being finalized
    - A full discussion of evaluation metrics will be added once the evaluation server is complete.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - 2014 release is limited to a subset of 80 categories
    - The following 11 categories are not included: hat, shoe, eyeglasses, mirror, window, door, street sign, plate, desk, blender, hair brush 
        - Not collected segmentations for these categories because they are too many instances, ambiguous and difficult to label, due to confusion with other categories, or too few instances
    - May add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Next, we analyze the properties of the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset in comparison to several other popular datasets. These include ImageNet [1] , PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] , and SUN [3] . Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images. ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

A summary of the datasets showing the number of object categories and the number of instances per category is shown in Fig. 5(d) . While MS COCO has fewer categories than ImageNet and SUN, it has more instances per category which we hypothesize will be useful for learning complex models capable of precise localization. In comparison to PASCAL VOC, MS COCO has both more categories and instances.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: To accommodate a faster release schedule, we split the MS COCO dataset into two roughly equal parts. The first half of the dataset was released in 2014, the second half will be released in 2015. The 2014 release contains 82,783 training, 40,504 validation, and 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test). There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images. We took care to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43] ) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims "to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time. One active field of research consists in analyzing laparoscopic video data to provide context-aware Division of computer Assisted Medical interventions (cAMi), German cancer Research center (DKfZ), im neuenheimer Feld 223, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims "to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time. One active field of research consists in analyzing laparoscopic video data to provide context-aware Division of computer Assisted Medical interventions (cAMi), German cancer Research center (DKfZ), im neuenheimer Feld 223, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Typically, a challenge has a training phase. At the beginning of the training phase, the challenge organizers release training cases with the relevant reference annotations 6 . These help the participating teams in developing their method (e.g. by training a machine learning algorithm). In the test phase, the participating teams either upload their algorithm, or they receive access to the test cases without the reference annotations and submit the results that their algorithm has achieved for the test cases to the challenge organizers. To enable comparative benchmarking to be executed for this challenge paradigm, our data set was split into a training set and a test set. Our data set was arranged such that it allows for validation of detection/ binary segmentation/multi-instance segmentation algorithms in three test stages:

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: The primary data set of this paper corresponds to the ROBUST-MIS 2019 challenge and features 30 surgical videos along with frame-based instrument annotations for more than 10,000 frames. The annotations for this data set underwent a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. This data set is complemented by surgical phase annotations for the 30 videos which were used in the Surgical Workflow Analysis in the sensorOR challenge organized in 2017.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: A limitation of our data set could be seen in the fact that the phase annotations were performed by only a single expert surgeon. It should be noted, however, that the phase annotations merely served as context information while the segmentations, which were generated with a highly quality-controlled process, are in the focus of this work. Furthermore, we acquired data from only one hospital. This implies limited variability with respect to the acquisition conditions as only one specific endoscope and light source were used. Still, to our knowledge, the HeiCo data set is the only publicly available data set (1) based on multiple different surgeries and (2) comprising not only annotated video data but also sensor data from medical devices in the operating room.
