  "Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

If there are entries with the same Dataset Name, merge them together. \n--- START OF TEXT\n- Dataset: Not specified \n- Characteristics:\n    - Goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding.\n    - Images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context\n    - Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization\n    - Contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old\n    - 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images\n    - Involved extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting, and instance segmentation\n    - Detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN \n    - Baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.\n\n- Dataset: Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO)\n- Characteristics:\n    - Compared to several other popular datasets: ImageNet, PASCAL VOC 2012, and SUN\n    - Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images\n    - ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained\n    - SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them\n    - PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images\n    - MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.\n\n- Dataset: MS COCO\n- Characteristics:\n    - Number of instances per category for all 91 categories is shown in Fig. 5(a)\n    - Summary of the datasets showing the number of object categories and the number of instances per category is shown in Fig. 5(d)\n    - MS COCO has fewer categories than ImageNet and SUN, but has more instances per category which can be useful for learning complex models capable of precise localization.\n    - In comparison to PASCAL VOC, MS COCO has both more categories and instances.\n\n- Dataset: MS COCO\n- Characteristics:\n    - Strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context\n    - The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image.\n    - For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled.\n    - On average MS COCO dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image\n    - In comparison, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average\n    - Only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC.\n    - SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.\n\n- Dataset: MS COCO and SUN\n- Characteristics:\n    - Analyze the average size of objects in the datasets\n    - Generally smaller objects are harder to recognize and require more contextual reasoning to recognize\n    - As shown in Fig. 5(e), the average sizes of objects is smaller for both MS COCO and SUN\n\n- Dataset: MS COCO\n- Characteristics:\n    - Split into two roughly equal parts:\n        - First half of the dataset was released in 2014\n        - Second half will be released in 2015\n    - 2014 release contains:\n        - 82,783 training images\n        - 40,504 validation images\n        - 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test)\n        - Nearly 270k segmented people \n        - Total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone\n    - 2015 release will contain:\n        - 165,482 training images\n        - 81,208 validation images\n        - 81,434 testing images\n    - Care was taken to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43]) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.\n\n- Dataset: Not specified\n- Characteristics:\n    - Following established protocol, annotations for train and validation data will be released, but not for test\n    - Evaluation server for automatic evaluation on the test set is being finalized\n    - A full discussion of evaluation metrics will be added once the evaluation server is complete.\n\n- Dataset: MS COCO\n- Characteristics:\n    - 2014 release is limited to a subset of 80 categories\n    - The following 11 categories are not included: hat, shoe, eyeglasses, mirror, window, door, street sign, plate, desk, blender, hair brush \n        - Not collected segmentations for these categories because they are too many instances, ambiguous and difficult to label, due to confusion with other categories, or too few instances\n    - May add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.\n--- END OF TEXT": "| Dataset | Size | Data Type | Balance | Originating Institution | Annotation | Format |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MS COCO | 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images | Images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context | Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization | Microsoft | Yes | Unknown |\n",

  "Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims \"to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data\" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time.

  "Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Typically, a challenge has a training phase. At the beginning of the training phase, the challenge organizers release training cases with the relevant reference annotations 6 . These help the participating teams in developing their method (e.g. by training a machine learning algorithm). In the test phase, the participating teams either upload their algorithm, or they receive access to the test cases without the reference annotations and submit the results that their algorithm has achieved for the test cases to the challenge organizers. To enable comparative benchmarking to be executed for this challenge paradigm, our data set was split into a training set and a test set. Our data set was arranged such that it allows for validation of detection/ binary segmentation/multi-instance segmentation algorithms in three test stages:": "[[\"training phase\", \"training cases\", \"reference annotations\"], [\"test phase\", \"test cases\", \"without reference annotations\"], [\"data set\", \"split into training and test set\", \"validation of detection/binary segmentation/multi-instance segmentation algorithms\", \"3 test stages\"]]",

  "Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: A limitation of our data set could be seen in the fact that the phase annotations were performed by only a single expert surgeon. It should be noted, however, that the phase annotations merely served as context information while the segmentations, which were generated with a highly quality-controlled process, are in the focus of this work. Furthermore, we acquired data from only one hospital. This implies limited variability with respect to the acquisition conditions as only one specific endoscope and light source were used.
