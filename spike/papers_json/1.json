    "abstract": "Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

                "text": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision lead to a rapid development of deep learning technology [1] in medical image analysis and digital medicine [2\u00c07] . With end-to-end learning of deep representation, deep supervised learning, as a unified methodology, achieved remarkable success in numerous 2D and 3D medical image tasks, e.g., classification [8] , detection [9] , segmentation [10] . With the rise of deep learning, infrastructures, algorithms and data (with annotations) are known to be the keys to its success. Computer-aided diagnosis with a high-performance deep learning is expected to save human labor, improve diagnosis consistency and accuracy, personalize patient treatment, and improve patient\u00c0doctor relationship. [11] Rib fracture represents an important indicator of trauma severity; the number of fractured ribs increases morbidity and mortality [12] . Multidetector computed tomography (CT) provides a more accurate assessment to evaluate for the presence of rib fractures when standard posteroanterior (PA) chest radiograph is specific but insensitive [12\u00c015] . Definite diagnosis (counting) of the number of rib fractures is also an important indicator in forensic examination for degree of disability [14, 16, 17] . However, the identification of rib fracture in CT images using conventional axial thin (1\u00c01.5 mm) images is a difficult and labor-intensive task. Each rib has a complex shape with a diagonal course across numerous CT sections [18] , which leads to missing rib fracture diagnosis (detection) in clinical practice. For instance, buckle fractures are the most frequently missing type of fracture reported in 2012 [19, 20] , due to the confusing appearance; nondisplaced rib fractures could be missing when parallel to the scan plane of the CT images. Besides, diagnosing subtle fractures is tedious and time-consuming for a large number of CT slices, which must be evaluated sequentially, rib-by-rib and side-by-side [18] .",

Few prior studies explore the development and validation of deep learning algorithms in this application. We proposed an automatic system named FracNet based on 3D UNet [21] , trained and evaluated with a large-scale dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, consisting of 7,473 voxellevel rib fracture segmentation from 900 chest-abdomen CT scans (332,483 CT slices). The annotation of RibFrac Dataset followed a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure, which ensures a high standard of annotation quality. On RibFrac test cohort, the proposed Frac-Net system achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% (with 5.27 false positives per scan) and a segmentation Dice Coefficient of 71.5%, which outperformed counterpart methods based on 3D variants of FCN [22] and DeepLab v3+ [23] with a 3D ResNet-18 backbone [24, 25] . Furthermore, observer studies with two experienced radiologists, including independent human-only study and humancollobration study, were designed to validate the clinical value of the proposed system. Our system achieved higher detection sensitivities than human experts. Importantly, human-computer collaboration significantly improved detection sensitivities over computer-only and human-only diagnosis, with reduced clinical time compared to human-only diagnosis.",

During training, each batch consisted of 12 positive and 12 negative samples. Data augmentation of random plane flipping was applied. We used a combination of soft Dice loss and binary cross-entropy (BCE) to train our network: where y 1 ; y 2 denote the ground truth and prediction of rib fracture segmentation, respectively, and ndenotes the batch size. We trained the network using Adam optimizer [29] with a warm-up training strategy. The learning rate linearly increased from 0.00001 to 0.1 during the first epoch, and then linearly decreased to 0.001 in 100 epochs.

The human-only diagnosis outperformed FracNet with given false positive levels. However, the human-computer collaboration could further improve their performance with reduced clinical time. Basically, the humancomputer collaboration followed the workflow of the FracNet system in clinical scenario: (a) model prediction (Model), (b) manual false positive reduction and verification (FPR), and (c) missing lesion detection and segmentation (Segmentation). Compared to conventional manual diagnosis by human experts (R1 and R2), the humancomputer collaboration significantly improved the detection sensitivities by large margins, with a sight cost in increasing false positives. Nevertheless, the computer-aided diagnosis with FracNet reduced the clinical time for rib fracture detection and segmentation.

As discussed in Section 3.1, the rib fractures were generally associated with elongated shapes; The formalization with segmentation masks in our study was expected to be more accurate than that with detection bounding boxes in these related studies. To our knowledge, it is the first study for rib fracture segmentation. Besides, the data and annotation were of higher standard in our study. High-quality thin-slice CT scans with thickness of 1\u00c01.25 mm were used in our study, compared to 1.5 mm [30] and partially 5 mm [679 of 974 patients (about 69.7%)] [31] . It was reported that thin-slice images could be helpful for the diagnosis of bone fractures and incidental findings [32] . On the other hand, we adapted a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure (Section 2.1.2), five radiologists were envovled to ensure the high quality of our annotations, which could help to reduce the risk of overestimating model performance [4,33\u00c035] . For these reasons, our model achieved a significantly higher detection sensitivity with less time-comsuing as time is crucial for trauma patients in the emergency setting throughout the whole diagnostic and therapeutic management process [36] . The model performance was consistent on our external training, tuning and test cohorts. More importantly, we open source the first large scale dataset for rib fracture detection and segmentaiton with voxellevel annotations, to improve research reproducibility and facilitate further research.",

In our site, the performance of diagnostic performance between junior and senior human experts was similar, this may benefit from the expertise of our radiologists in rib fracture diagnosis. However, in our experience, the diagnostic performance of radiologists with different expertise from different sites may vary significantl. Besides, even the annotations were verified with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure, there could still be false positive or false negative annotation. Moreover, the landscape of deep neural networks was not fully explored. In further studies, we are investigating model generalization of our method on multi-center datasets, with more rounds of human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. It is also interesting to explore segmentation loss for elongated objects [37, 38] or leverage the pretraining from natural / medical images [39, 40] . Apart from automatic rib fracture detection and segmentation, we are also developing datasets and models to automatically classify the fracture types. We will also introduce recent advances in 3D deep learning to improve the model performance.",
