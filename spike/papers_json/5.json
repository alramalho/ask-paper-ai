                "text": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide (17.9 million people die each year), and 85% of all cardiovascular disease deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes. Indeed, myocardial infarction (MI) or heart attack is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood flow to the heart is abruptly stopped. This is generally due to a blockage in one or more of the coronary arteries and that results in tissue damage. A patient with acute myocardial infarction needs an emergency revascularization therapy in order to restore perfusion as soon as possible. However, when this revascularization fails, an extensive damage which consists in an obstruction called persistent microvascular obstruction (MVO) can appear [1] [2] [3] (known also as no-reflow phenomenon). Among the patients with MI, determining which of them will benefit from revascularization is of obvious clinical significance. One crucial parameter is the viability of the myocardial segments, i.e., to estimate if the myocardial segment with suspected myocardial infarction is viable or not, in other words, if the segment can recover its functionality upon revascularization. MRI performed several minutes after the injection of a contrast agent (defined as delayed enhancement-MRI or DE-MRI) is a method of choice to evaluate the extent of MI, and by extension, to assess viable tissues after an injury (in conjunction with the thickening of the muscle evaluated from cine-MRI) [4] [5] [6] . In addition, in current practice, the medical doctor does not only possess the imaging data but also clinical information about the patients, and their report is therefore also based on this information.",

This dataset could also be used to design classification approaches allowing to detect whether the exam is normal or pathological from only the clinical information, or based on the combination of clinical information and DE-MRI. Other datasets have already been published with DE-MRI, but they are different than our proposal. The dataset provided by Karim et al. [9] included only fifteen human cases. More recent challenges during the MICCAI conference provided DE-MRI with expert annotations, such as the MS-CMRSeg challenge in 2019 [10] and the MyoPS challenge in 2020 [11] , but the number of cases was lower than that in our dataset. Other important features that render our dataset unique are the presence of normal cases and the knowledge of the clinical characteristics associated with the exam.",

In particular, the increase in gadolinium concentration within fibrotic tissue causes T1 shortening, which appears as bright signal intensity in the T1-weighted cardiac DE-MRI. The physiological basis of the gadolinium enhancement of myocardial fibrosis after several minutes is based upon the combination of an increased volume of distribution for the contrast agent and a prolonged washout related to the decreased capillary density within the myocardial fibrotic tissue [13, 14] . The fibrotic area appears bright in T1-weighted MRI when the acquisition is obtained roughly 10 min after the injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent, whereas normal tissue appears dark. We make note of the difference between early enhancement that can be studied one or two minutes after injection of the contrast agent, and the study of late enhancement, such as in our case, with acquisition roughly 10 min after the injection. The amount of contrast agent in the myocardium and the corresponding grey level on the images can be influenced by many factors, such as the renal clearance, the type of contrast media, the contrast dose, the delay between the injection of the contrast agent and the image acquisition, and the sequence parameters, among others. In our dataset, the contrast media and the sequence parameters are always the same; however, the variation of the other features involves differences in the image signal. Persistent MVO is due to persistent perfusion defect and causes irreversible damages to the intracellular zone, which finally leads to tissue death [15, 16] . This latter area appears in black on T1-weighted MRI regardless of time delay between the injection of the contrast agent and the image acquisition and is always surrounded by bright area (corresponding to myocardial infarction, as shown in Figure 1c ). In the presence of scar with a transmurality of 50% or in the significant presence of MVO, late gadolinium enhancement is sufficient to predict functional recovery. Fifty one percent of pathological cases have persistent MVO. For each image, the contours of the myocardium, as well as the contours of the infarcted area and the MVO areas, if present, are considered as the ground truths. From the contours, specific labels are assigned to each voxel depending on its location: in the background, in the myocardium, in the myocardial infarction area, and in the MVO area, respectively. These masks are provided with the dataset. The whole input images are provided using a NIfTI format, i.e., one file for the whole images covering the left ventricle for one case, and also one NIfTI file with the associated ground truths.",

The study of the electrocardiogram (ECG) allows classifying the heart attack as STEMI type or not. STEMI stands for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The ST segment refers to the flat section of an ECG reading and represents the interval between jagged heartbeats. When a person has a heart attack, this segment will no longer be flat but will appear abnormally elevated [17] . STEMI is the most serious type of heart attack, which is characterized by a long interruption of blood supply. A troponin test measures the levels of troponin T or troponin I proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as during a myocardial infarction. A value less than 0.1 is considered normal, and a value higher than 0.4 is generally considered pathological [17] . The Killip score between 1 and 4 is a classification which was proposed in 1967 based on the physical examination of patients with possible acute myocardial infarction [18] . The different classes of the Killip score are detailed in Table 1 . ",

Then, the second expert (a well-trained biophysicist with 20 years of experience) went through every outline and made some changes when necessary. During the contouring of the endocardial border, the papillary muscles were included in the cavity. For the contouring of the epicardial border, the expert only considered the muscle, the fat was in particular excluded, and there was an extrapolation of the contour at the level of the junction of the two ventricles. The persistent MVO area being defined as a black area surrounded by a bright area, the experts were requested to draw these black areas as persistent MVO areas while discarding black signal due to noise or artefacts. Examples are shown in Figure 2 . Considering manual contouring instead of a semi-automatic approach ensures that questionable contours (due to the presence of artifacts, for example) are only due to the choice of the experts and do not depend on algorithm settings. We studied the intra-and inter-observer variations on 34 other cases outside this dataset. Thanks to the metric calculation method available on the Emidec website, we found a Dice index for the myocardium and for the MI of 0.84 and 0.76, respectively, for the intra-observer study, and of 0.83 and 0.69, respectively, for the inter-observer study.",
