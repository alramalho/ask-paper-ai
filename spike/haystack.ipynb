    "# Tutorial: Build Your First Question Answering System\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've modified this first tutorial to make it simpler to start with. If you're looking for a Question Answering tutorial that uses a DocumentStore such as Elasticsearch, go to our new [Build a Scalable Question Answering System](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/03_scalable_qa_system) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: Beginner\n",
    "- **Time to complete**: 15 minutes\n",
    "- **Nodes Used**: `InMemoryDocumentStore`, `BM25Retriever`, `FARMReader`\n",
    "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about the Reader and Retriever, and built a question answering pipeline that can answer questions about the Game of Thrones series.\n"

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to build a question answering system using Haystack's DocumentStore, Retriever, and Reader. Your system will use Game of Thrones files and will be able to answer questions like \"Who is the father of Arya Stark?\". But you can use it to run on any other set of documents, such as your company's internal wikis or a collection of financial reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started quicker, we simplified certain steps in this tutorial. For example, Document preparation and pipeline initialization are handled by ready-made classes that replace lines of initialization code. But don't worry! This doesn't affect how well the question answering system performs."
