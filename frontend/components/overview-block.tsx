          <Text>Ask Paper allows you to more quickly read and extract information from papers. It allows you to upload
            papers either
            by URL or by uploading a PDF file, and then ask natural language questions about the paper (e.g. What is
            the paper about).
            You also have predefined actions like <code>Extract Datasets</code> and <code>Generate
              summary</code>.<br /><br />
            Plus, it is natively multiligual, so you can ask questions in any language you want!

          <Text>Ask Paper is a tool powered by a Large Language Model. This is a Neural Network that was trained
            on a lot of internet text to get a fundamental understanding on how the language works, all by trying to
            predict
            the next word in a sequence. By feeding the paper contents and the query to the models, it will try to
            "predict" a plausible answer!
          </Text>
          <Text><b>Careful!</b> As stated above, this is only trained to generate <b>plausible</b> answers, so you're
            encouraged
            to verify its veracity. You can take usage of the "Quote" Switch in order to force the answer to contain
            paper quotes,
            minimizing wrong content</Text>
