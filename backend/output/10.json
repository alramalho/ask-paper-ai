The slower growing low-grade variants, such as low-grade astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas, come with a life expectancy of several years so aggressive treatment is often delayed as long as possible. For both groups, intensive neuroimaging protocols are used before and after treatment to evaluate the progression of the disease and the success of a chosen treatment strategy. In current clinical routine, as well as in clinical studies, the resulting images are evaluated either based on qualitative criteria only (indicating, for example, the presence of characteristic hyper-intense tissue appearance in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI), or by relying on such rudimentary quantitative measures as the largest diameter visible from axial images of the lesion [4] , [5] .",

However, developing automated brain tumor segmentation techniques is technically challenging, because lesion areas are only defined through intensity changes that are relative to surrounding normal tissue, and even manual segmentations by expert raters show significant variations when intensity gradients between adjacent structures are smooth or obscured by partial voluming or bias field artifacts. Furthermore, tumor structures vary considerably across patients in terms of size, extension, and localization, prohibiting the use of strong priors on shape and location that are important components in the segmentation of many other anatomical structures. Moreover, the so-called mass effect induced by the growing lesion may displace normal brain tissues, as do resection cavities that are present after treatment, thereby limiting the reliability of spatial prior knowledge for the healthy part of the brain. Finally, a large variety of imaging modalities can be used for mapping tumor-induced tissue changes, including T2 and FLAIR MRI (highlighting differences in tissue water relaxational properties), post-Gadolinium T1 MRI (showing pathological intratumoral take-up of contrast agents), perfusion and diffusion MRI (local water diffusion and blood flow), and 0278-0062 \u00a9 2014 IEEE.

Each of these modalities provides different types of biological information, and therefore poses somewhat different information processing tasks. Because of its high clinical relevance and its challenging nature, the problem of computational brain tumor segmentation has attracted considerable attention during the past 20 years, resulting in a wealth of different algorithms for automated, semi-automated, and interactive segmentation of tumor structures (see [6] and [7] for good reviews). Virtually all of these methods, however, were validated on relatively small private datasets with varying metrics for performance quantification, making objective comparisons between methods highly challenging. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that different combinations of imaging modalities are often used in validation studies, and that there is no consistency in the tumor sub-compartments that are considered. As a consequence, it remains difficult to judge which image segmentation strategies may be worthwhile to pursue in clinical practice and research; what exactly the performance is of the best computer algorithms available today; and how well current automated algorithms perform in comparison with groups of human expert raters.",

                "text": "Generative models make use of detailed prior information about the appearance and spatial distribution of the different tissue types. They often exhibit good generalization to unseen images, and represent the state-of-the-art for many brain tissue segmentation tasks [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Encoding prior knowledge for a lesion, however, is difficult. Tumors may be modeled as outliers relative to the expected shape [22] , [23] or image signal of healthy tissues [17] , [24] which is similar to approaches for other brain lesions, such as Multiple Sklerosis [25] , [26] . In [17] , for instance, a criterion for detecting outliers is used to generate a tumor prior in a subsequent expectation-maximizations segmentation which treats tumor as an additional tissue class. Alternatively, the spatial prior for the tumor can be derived from the appearance of tumor-specific \"bio-markers\" [27] , [28] , or from using tumor growth models to infer the most likely localization of tumor structures for a given set of patient images [29] . All these models rely on registration for accurately aligning images and spatial priors, which is often problematic in the presence of large lesions or resection cavities. In order to overcome this difficulty, both joint registration and tumor segmentation [18] , [30] and joint registration and estimation of tumor displacement [31] have been studied. A limitation of generative models is the significant effort required for transforming an arbitrary semantic interpretation of the image, for example, the set of expected tumor substructures a radiologist would like to have mapped in the image, into appropriate probabilistic models.",

In order to be robust against imaging artifacts and intensity and shape variations, they typically require substantial amounts of training data [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . As a first step, these methods typically extract dense, voxel-wise features from anatomical maps [35] , [39] calculating, for example, local intensity differences [40] [41] [42] , or intensity distributions from the wider spatial context of the individual voxel [39] , [43] , [44] . As a second step, these features are then fed into classification algorithms such as support vector machines [45] or decision trees [46] that learn boundaries between classes in the high-dimensional feature space, and return the desired tumor classification maps when applied to new data. One drawback of this approach is that, because of the explicit dependency on intensity features, segmentation is restricted to images acquired with the exact same imaging protocol as the one used for the training data. Even then, careful intensity calibration remains a crucial part of discriminative segmentation methods in general [47] [48] [49] , and tumor segmentation is no exception to this rule.",

Local regularity of tissue labels can be encoded via boundary modeling for both generative [17] , [55] and discriminative models [32] , [33] , [35] , [55] , [56] , potentially enforcing non-local shape constraints [57] . Markov random field (MRF) priors encourage similarity among neighboring labels in the generative context [25] , [37] , [38] . Similarly, conditional random fields (CRFs) help enforce-or prohibit-the adjacency of specific labels and, hence, impose constraints considering the wider spatial context of voxels [36] , [43] . While all these segmentation models act locally, more or less at the voxel level, other approaches consider prior knowledge about the relative location of tumor structures in a more global fashion. They learn, for example, the neighborhood relationships between such structures as edema, Gadolinium-enhancing tumor structures, or necrotic parts of the tumor through hierarchical models of super-voxel clusters [42] , [58] , or by relating image patterns with phenomenological tumor growth models adapted to patient scans [31] .",

During Spring 2012, participants were solicited through private e-mails as well as public e-mail lists and the MICCAI workshop announcements. Participants had to register with one of the online systems (cf. Section III-F) and could download annotated training data. They were asked to submit a four page summary of their algorithm, also reporting a cross-validated training error. Submissions were reviewed by the organizers and a final group of twelve participants were invited to contribute to the challenge. The training data the participants obtained in order to tune their algorithms consisted of multi-contrast MR scans of 10 low-and 20 high-grade glioma patients that had been manually annotated with two tumor labels (\"edema\" and \"core,\" cf. Section III-D) by a trained human expert. The training data also contained simulated images for 25 high-grade and 25 low-grade glioma subjects with the same two \"ground truth\" labels. In a subsequent \"on-site challenge\" at the MICCAI workshop, the teams were given a 12 h time period to evaluate previously unseen test images. The test images consisted of 11 high-and 4 low-grade real cases, as well as 10 high-and 5 low-grade simulated images. The resulting segmentations were then uploaded by each team to the online tools, which automatically computed performance scores for the two tumor structures. Of the twelve groups that participated in the benchmark, six submitted their results in time during the on-site challenge, and one group submitted their results shortly afterwards (Subbanna) . During the plenary discussions it became apparent that using only two basic tumor classes was insufficient as the \"core\" label contained substructures with very different appearances in the different modalities. We therefore had all the training data re-annotated with four tumor labels, refining the initially rather broad \"core\" class by labels for necrotic, cystic and enhancing substructures. We asked all twelve workshop participants to update their algorithms to consider these new labels and to submit their segmentation II  OVERVIEW OF THE ALGORITHMS EMPLOYED IN 2012 AND 2013.

Our emphasis is on the last of the three tests. Table II contains an overview of the methods used by the participating groups in both challenges. In 2012, four out of the twelve participants used generative models, one was a generative-discriminative approach, and five were discriminative; seven used some spatially regularizing model component. Two methods required manual initialization. The two automated segmentation methods that topped the list of competitors during the on-site challenge of the first benchmark used a discriminative probabilistic approach relying on a random forest classifier, boosting the popularity of this approach in the second year. As a result, in 2013 participants employed one generative model, one discriminative-generative model, and eight discriminative models out of which a total of four used random forests as the central learning algorithm; seven had a processing step that enforced spatial regularization. One method required manual initialization. A detailed description of each method is available in the workshop proceedings, 3 as well as in the Appendix/Online Supporting Information.",

The images represent a mix of pre-and post-therapy brain scans, with two volumes showing resections. They were acquired at four different centers-Bern University, Debrecen University, Heidelberg University, and Massachusetts General Hospital-over the course of several years, using MR scanners from different vendors and with different field strengths (1.5T and 3T) and implementations of the imaging sequences (e.g., 2D or 3D). The image datasets used in the study all share the following four MRI contrasts (Fig. 2) . 1) T1: T1-weighted, native image, sagittal or axial 2D acquisitions, with 1-6 mm slice thickness. 2) T1c: T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium) image, with 3D acquisition and 1 mm isotropic voxel size for most patients. 3) T2: T2-weighted image, axial 2D acquisition, with 2-6 mm slice thickness. 4) FLAIR: T2-weighted FLAIR image, axial, coronal, or sagittal 2D acquisitions, 2-6 mm slice thickness. To homogenize these data we co-registered each subject's image volumes rigidly to the T1c MRI, which had the highest spatial resolution in most cases, and resampled all images to 1 mm isotropic resolution in a standardized axial orientation with a linear interpolator. We used a rigid registration model with the mutual information similarity metric as it is implemented in ITK [74] (\"VersorRigid3DTransform\" with \"MattesMutualInformation\" similarity metric and three multi-resolution levels). No attempt was made to put the individual patients in a common reference space. All images were skull stripped [75] to guarantee anomymization of the patients.",

The initial \"edema\" segmentation in T2 and FLAIR contained the core structures that were then relabeled in subsequent steps [ Fig. 3(A) ]. 2) As an aid to the segmentation of the other three tumor substructures, the so-called gross tumor core-including both enhancing and non-enhancing structures-was first segmented by evaluating hyper-intensities in T1c (for highgrade cases) together with the inhomogenous component of the hyper-intense lesion visible in T1 and the hypo-intense regions visible in T1 [ Fig. 3(B) ]. 3) The \"enhancing core\" of the tumor was subsequently segmented by thresholding T1c intensities within the resulting gross tumor core, including the Gadolinium enhancing tumor rim and excluding the necrotic center and vessels. 5) Finally, the \"non-enhancing (solid) core\" structures were defined as the remaining part of the gross tumor core, i.e., after subtraction of the \"enhancing core\" and the \"necrotic (or fluid-filled) core\" structures [ Fig. 3(D) ]. Following this protocol, the MRI scans were annotated by a trained team of radiologists and altogether seven radiographers in Bern, Debrecen and Boston. They outlined structures in every third axial slice, interpolated the segmentation using morphological operators (region growing), and visually inspected the results in order to perform further manual corrections, if necessary. All segmentations were performed using the 3D slicer software 5 , taking about 60 min per subject. As mentioned previously, the tumor labels used initially in the BRATS challenge contained only two classes for both high-and low-grade glioma cases: \"edema,\" which was defined similarly as the edema class above, and \"core\" representing the three core classes. The simulated data used in the 2012 challenge also had ground truth labels only for \"edema\" and \"core.\"",

Results of this evaluation also serve as a baseline we can use to compare our algorithms against in a second step. As combining several segmentations may potentially lead to consensus labels that are of higher quality than the individual segmentations, we perform an experiment that applies the hierarchical fusion algorithm to the automatic segmentations as a final step. LG cases for the real images and 10/5 HG/LG cases for the synthetic scans. All datasets from the 2012 on-site challenge featured \"whole\" and \"core\" region labels only. On-site test set for 2013 consisted of 10 real HG cases with four-class annotations, of which \"whole,\" \"core,\" \"active\" regions were evaluated (see text). Best results for each task are underlined. Top performing algorithms of the on-site challenge were Hamamci, Zikic, and Bauer in 2012; and Tustison, Meier, and Reza in 2013. Fig. 5 analyzes the inter-rater variability in the four-label manual segmentations of the training scans (30 cases, four different raters), as well as of the final off-site test scans (15 cases, three raters). The results for the training and test datasets are overall very similar, although the inter-rater variability is a bit higher (lower Dice scores) in the test set, indicating that images in our training dataset were slightly easier to segment (Fig. 5 , plots at the top). The scores obtained by comparing individual raters against the consensus segmentation provides an estimate of an upper limit for the performance of any algorithmic segmentation, indicating that segmenting the whole tumor region for both low-and high-grade and the tumor core region for high-grade is comparatively easy, while identifying the \"core\" in low-grade glioma and delineating the enhancing structures for high-grade cases is considerably more difficult (Fig. 5 , table at the bottom). The comparison between an individual rater and the consensus segmentation, however, may be somewhat overly optimistic with respect to the upper limit of accuracy that can be obtained on the given datasets, as the consensus label is generated using the rater's segmentation it is compared against. So we use the inter-rater variation as an unbiased proxy that we compare with the algorithmic segmentations in the remainder. This sets the bar that has to be passed by an algorithm to Dice scores in the high 80% for the whole tumor region (median 87%), to scores in the high 80% for \"core\" region (median 94% for high-grade, median 82% for low-grade), and to average scores in the high 70% for \"active\" tumor region (median 77%) ( Fig. 5 , table at the bottom).",

Several factors may have led to this discrepancy. Some of the groups had difficulties in submitting viable results during the \"on-site\" challenge and resolved them only for the \"off-site\" evaluation (Menze, Riklin Raviv). Others used algorithms during the \"off-site\" challenge that were significantly updated and reworked after the 2012 event (Subbanna, Shin) . All 2012 participants had to adapt their algorithms to the new four-class labels and, if discriminative learning methods were used, to retrain their algorithms which also may have contributed to fluctuations in performance.

This observation aligns well with a common concept from ensemble learning, when a set of predictors that are unbiased but with high variability in the individual prediction, improve when their predictions are pooled [83] . In that case, averaging over multiple predictors reduces variance and, hence, reduces the prediction error. Subselecting only the best few segmentations, i.e., those with the least bias (or average misclassification) further improves results. In general there are two extrema: variance is maximal for single observations and minimal after fusing many, while bias is minimal for the one top-ranking algorithm and maximal when including a large number of (also lesser) predictions. For many applications, an optimum is reached in between these two extrema, depending on the bias and variance of the predictors that are fused. Optimizing the ensemble prediction by balancing variability reduction (fuse many predictors) and bias removal (fuse a few selected only) can be done on a test set representing the overall population, or for the individual image volume when partial annotation is available-for example from the limited user interaction mentioned above. Statistical methods that estimate and weight the performance of individual contributions-for example, based on appropriate multi-class extensions of STAPLE [69] and related probabilistic models [19] , [84] -may also be used to trade bias and variance in an optimal fashion.",

Although the registration itself was found to work well (as it was always between images acquired from the same subject and in the same acquisition session), it may have been advisable to use a more advanced interpolation method, because the image resolution differed significantly between sequences, patients, and centers. Furthermore, in order to build a consensus segmentation from multiple manual annotations, we devised a simple fusion rule that explicitly respects the known spatial and-with respect to the evolution of the disease-temporal relations between the tumor substructures, as more advanced fusion schemes were found to yield implausible results. These choices can certainly be criticized; however, we believe the major challenge for the segmentation algorithms was ultimately not interpolation or label fusion details, but rather the large spatial and structural variability of the tumors in the BRATS dataset, as well as the variability in image intensities arising from differences in imaging equipment and acquisition protocols.",

Detecting such failures would require a meticulous study of each element of every processing pipeline-for a learning-based approach, for example, of the intensity normalization, the feature extraction, the classification algorithm, and the spatial regularization.

After pre-processing (denoising, bias-field correction, rescaling and histogram matching) [74] , the segmentation task is modeled as an energy minimization problem in a conditional random field (CRF) formulation. The energy consists of the sum of the singleton potentials in the first term and the pairwise potentials in the second term of (1). The expression is minimized using [88] in a hierarchical way (1) The singleton potentials are computed according to (2) , where is the label output from a classifier, is the feature vector and is the Kronecker-function (2) We use a decision forest as a classifier [89] , which has the advantage of being able to handle multi-class problems and providing a probabilistic output [89] . The probabilistic output is used for the weighting factor in (2), in order to control the degree of spatial regularization. A 44-dimensional feature vector is used for the classifier, which combines the inten-sities in each modality with the first-order textures (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, energy, entropy) computed from local patches, statistics of intensity gradients in a local neighborhood and symmetry features across the mid-sagittal plane. The pairwise potentials account for the spatial regularization. In 3is a weighting function, which depends on the voxel spacing in each dimension. The term penalizes different labels of adjacent voxels, while the intensity term regulates the degree of smoothing based on the local intensity variation, where PCD is a pseudo-Chebyshev distance and is a generalized mean intensity.",

The model captures the main concepts by which the immune system recognizes pathogens and models the process in a numerical form. GAIN+ was adapted to support a variable number of input patterns for training and segmentation of tumors in MRI brain images. The model was demonstrated to operate with multi-spectral MR data with an increase in accuracy compared to the single spectrum case. The new input patterns include, in any combination, voxel intensities from 2D or 3D blocks or shapes of varying sizes customized to each MRI sequence (T1, T2, FLAIR, etc.), and also include feature and textural patterns such as mean and variance of selected block sizes, slice or radial distance, co-occurrence matrices, among others. Due to the representation of the voxel intensities as multi-bit values, it can be shown that not every bit carries the same entropy. That is, each bit does not contribute equally to the final interpretation of the data. The GAIN algorithm makes use of this fact to increase the speed of its operation. Bits are grouped into groups of size 2 bits. A new grouping approach was implemented based on the location of each bit within the input pattern, and the significance of the input features. Higher priority was given to higher order bits and overall to voxels at closer distance to the center voxel. This grouping approach runs in just a few seconds and the same grouping file can be used for all cases. Training takes an average of 1.3 min per input byte, thus, for example, an input pattern of 16 bytes takes an average of 21 min of training. Segmentation with post-processing of one case takes 20 s for the same input size. The preprocessing pipeline was designed to remove noise and inhomogeneities due to MR scanner bias fields, and match each spectrum's intensity histogram to the volumes used for training. Several post-processing options were added to the program, such as finding and extracting connected components, and performing dilation and erosion on those components.",

At each step, weighted votes are rebalanced based on label frequencies, in order to penalize labels which would be more often picked if the patch retrieval were blind. As post-processing, at most the two biggest connected components of the complete tumor are kept, the second one being kept only if its volume is greater than 20% of the volume of the first one.

Finally, since some FLAIR images were already limited to the volume of interest, all sequences from each subject were cropped to have the same brain volume. A random decision forest is used to classify each brain voxel, based on several features extracted from the training data. The main parameters in a decision forest are the number of trees and their depth, set to 50 and 25, respectively. Due to computational limitations, a maximum of points per training subject were sampled. Half of these points are background and the other half are tumor and edema. The feature set includes: 1) MR sequences intensities and the difference between each two sequences; 2) neighborhood information with the mean, sum, median and intensity range of 3D cubic neighborhoods with edges of 3, 9, and 19 mm, centered in each voxel, from all MR sequences and the differences between sequences; 3) context information as the difference between each voxel and the mean value of 3 3 3 mm cubes, centered 3 mm from the voxel in six directions (two per axis), from all sequences; 4) texture information in all MR sequences, including edge density and local binary partition (signal and magnitude) extracted from 3 3 mm neighborhoods, and the Laws texture features [105] extracted from 2D 3 neighborhoods, in all three dimensions. Finally, a post processing step was performed assuming that very small isolated 3D regions, with less than seven voxels (value found empirically), of one label type should not exist. The total execution time is about 30 min for each test subject, mainly due to the features extraction, using the programming language Python on a computer with an Intel processor (i7-3930k, 3.2 GHz).",

The features set, as well as the hyperparameters for the decision forest, were found using leave-one-out cross-validation of the Training dataset.

Similarly, images were normalized to a low-grade reference when segmenting these tumors. The critical part of the proposed algorithm is the normalization, which influences the whole pipeline, especially with intensity related features used in a supervised classifier.

With a better texture characterization, it is expected to achieve further improvement in the segmentation of brain tumors.",

For the BRATS challenge, the method was extended to multi-modal MRI to include also the labels for edema and non-enhanced regions. Hamamci and Unal's approach to fuse different MR modalities is to apply the original tumor-cut method to each channel seperately and then combine the segmented volumes by basic set operations based on the type of the modality. For each channel, a segmentation is initialized by drawing the maximum observable diameter of the tumor and performed independently (see Fig. 10 ). For FLAIR images, whole hyper-intense region is segmented as FLAIR volume and for T2 images only the core abnormality is segmented as T2 volume . Tumor core is segmented on contrast enhanced T1 MRI followed by the application of the necrotic segmentation method to segment the necrotic regions within the tumor core .

As a classifier we employ a classification forest. The predicted class label is defined according to the MAP-rule applied on the posterior probability output from the classification forest. The implementation of the classification forest is based on the Sherwood library [46] . The regularization is conducted in a hierarchical manner as proposed in [106] . It is realized as an energy minimization problem of a conditional random field, which is defined on a grid graph representing the image. The probabilistic output of the classification forest is further used to define the unary potentials, which model the affiliation of a voxel to a possible tissue class. Pairwise potentials model the coherence between neighboring voxels and are used to incorporate tissue dependencies and to account for anisotropic voxel dimensions. For solving the energy minimization problem we relied on the Fast-PD algorithm proposed in [88] .",

To initialize our algorithm we segment the volume into the three healthy and an outlier class using a freely available implementation of the EM segmentation with bias correction [25] . Outliers are defined as being more than three standard deviations away from the centroid of any of the three normal tissue classes. We apply our algorithm to the bias field corrected volumes returned from this EM segmenter and initialize intensity parameters with values estimated in the initial segmentation. We initialize the latent atlas to 0.7 time the local prior for the presence of gray or white matter. For a semantic interpretation that is in line with the class definitions of the segmentation challenge, Channels-specific segmentations returned by our algorithm are transformed to Edema and Core classes. We label voxels that show tumor specific changes in the T2 channel as edema, and voxels that show hyper-intense tumor specific changes as tumor core. A discriminative classifier filters all tumor segments removing those that are most likely to be false positives, primarily evaluating shape and location of the tumor regions returned from the generative model.",

As a consequence, we propose to use the probabilistic output of the generative model, together with few structural features that are derived from the same probabilistic maps, as input to a classifier modeling the posterior of the desired pixel classes.

The most time consuming parts are preprocessing and feature extraction which are done offline. All results in this work are obtained using MATLAB 2011a on windows 64 bit 2.26 GHz Intel Xeon processor, with 12 GB RAM. We process HG and LG patients separately for both Leader Board and Challenge testing phases. There are a few leader board cases that show low scores. Our observation suggests that if the tumor tissue intensities are below the mean intensity of the image, the necrosis tissues are misclassified as non-tumor. Data redundancy in the samples and covariance among the features usually lower the classifier performance. In summary, our extensive experimental results with BRATS data confirm the efficacy of our texture-based methods for multi-class abnormal brain tissue segmentation.",

                "text": "Unsupervised learning approaches have potential for applications in medical image processing, as previously discussed [111] [112] [113] . Additionally, the approach can be extended readily to a previously unseen dataset avoiding the issues of overfitting that can occur in supervised learning methods, where overfitting has a larger influence in tumor segmentation when tumors have very heterogeneous characteristics. Unsupervised learning approaches were applied 1) in [112] for the previous two-class segmentation challenge, and 2) in [113] to detect multiple organs from a dataset where a few roughly labeled samples were available. These methods however were not directly applicable when the format of this challenge was changed to classify four-class labels. The four-class segmentation problem was therefore approached with a supervised learning algorithm, used previously in [112] , to segment the tumor-cores, trained with logistic regression. Four-dimensional patches (3 3 3 volume-patch channels) were used with second-order polynomial features as described in [112] , as opposed to the three-dimensional patches ( 2-D image-patch temporal-dimension) used previously in [113] to identify organs (but not for segmentation). This was because the dataset for this challenge was carefully registered with little motion, compared to the abdominal scans in [113] where the registration over the 40 volumes along the time-course was difficult as the region is usually affected by breathing motion. Deep neural networks with up to six layers were tried as well, pre-training the hidden-layers with stackedautoencoder feature learning and subsequently fine-tuning them with the labeled samples in the training dataset. Neural network model was not used for the challenge however, because the improvement of classification accuracy was small relatively to the higher complexity compared to the logistic regression model. Each channel of volumes was normalized separately, to try to learn the relation between the multi-channel intensity values, and to avoid any biases in the image intensities in different scans. The same type of classifier was used to classify all labels including the not-of-interest label (label:0), where they were trained only on the patient-dataset which has four-class labels, and applied to synthetic data which has only two labels. Two cross-validations were performed for the parameter adaptation, and no additional post-processing steps were applied to the patch-wise classification. It took about 5-10 min to segment a volume depending on the size of the whole head in the volume, as the classifier scans through all the non-zero entities. The segmentation result is reasonably good, especially considering that only patch-wise classification was performed for the segmentation without any post-processing step, with a single (type of) classifier being used to segment all tumor classes and data-types (patient/synthetic). This demonstrates the application of a classification model applied to the segmentation of coarsely labeled tumors. Combining any post-processing steps might provide an immediate improvement on the final segmentation result, while application of unsupervised methods could be studied in the future for this four-class segmentation, e.g., segmenting label: x-vs-rest for all labels individually but similarly to [112] . Extending the classification model to a structured prediction model is an interesting avenue for future work for this model, while using a whole volume as an input to deep convolutional neural networks [114] might be worth investigating for the application of neural network models.",

At the first stage, the goal is to coarsely segment tumors (and associated sub-classes) from surrounding healthy tissues using texture features. During training, specialized Gabor functions are developed to optimally separate tumors from surrounding healthy tissues based on combined-space coefficients of tumors in multispectral brain MRIs [120] . A Bayesian classification framework is designed such that models for tumour/non-tumors are built during training, based on the combined space Gabor decomposition. During testing, a Bayesian classifier results in tumour/non-tumor probabilities and coarse tumor boundaries around regions with high tumor probabilities. Prior probabilities for healthy brain tissues are obtained by registering a healthy tissue prior atlas to regions outside tumor boundaries [118] The coarse boundaries are refined at the voxel level through a modified MRF framework that carefully separates different tumor subclasses from each other and from healthy tissues. This customized MRF differs from standard MRFs in that it is not simply a smoothing operator on priors. In addition to taking voxel intensities and class labels into account, it also models intensity differences between neighboring voxels in the likelihood model and considers transition probabilities between neighboring voxel classes. The second inference stage is shown to resolve local inhomogeneities and impose a smoothing constraint, while maintaining appropriate boundaries as supported by local intensity difference observations.",

No other datasets were used for training or tuning. Online segmentation statistics (e.g., Dice overlap metrics) were provided. For training cases, the method was tested in a leave-one-out fashion. After training, the algorithm was tested on all test cases. On I7 Dell Optiplex machines, the training took a day, due to both convolution and simulated annealing algorithms used. Each volume took 70 min to classify, due to time consuming convolutions with different Gabor filters. For tumor core segmentation, the technique outperformed the top methods by about 30% in the clinical test cases in terms of Dice statistics, and had comparable performance with the highest performing methods in terms of segmentation of other tumour regions (in all statistics) for both training and test cases. In terms of shortcomings, the classifier is currently heavily dependent on the normalization step performing adequately, which caused a problem in at least one HG test case.

The preprocessing pipeline has been designed to remove spatial inhomogeneities due to patient movement, remove image artifacts (skull, eyes) not related to the segmentation problem, remove inhomogeneities due to MR scanner bias fields, and match each spectrum's intensity histogram to the volumes used for training. Training the HMM (Fig. 12) involves extracting a feature vector for each voxel in the source case. We extract intensity voxels from FLAIR, T1, T1C, and T2 MR spectra. Neighboring voxels are added to the feature vector. The corresponding truth labels for the voxel neighborhood in the feature vector is utilized for supervised training of the HMM. Extending the HMM model to Map-Reduce (Fig. 12) involved adapting the HMM supervised learning algorithm to incrementally update based on individual feature vectors and coding a Mapper to perform feature extraction. In our current case, a single Mapper handles a single training case, extracting all of the feature vectors for the case and providing the vectors to the Reducer. The Reducer collects the feature vectors from all of the Mappers and incrementally updates the HMM model as new feature vectors are produced. A final Controller normalizes the probabilities in the HMM (initial, transition, emission) and stores the HMM to a file. The HMM was trained with the BRATS 2013 high-grade training data.",

Voxels from FLAIR, T1, T1C, and T2 in a neighborhood around the voxel of interest are organized into the feature vector and provided to the trained HMM model. The HMM model produces a predicted label for the feature vector. Postprocessing involved filtering out small objects and applying dilation and erosion operations on each segmented class. Our method has been evaluated on the BRATS2013 challenge dataset for high-grade glioma cases. We achieve an mean accuracy (Dice score) of [59.5] % for edema and [65.6] % for tumor in the real cases. The Map-Reduce enabled HMM is able to train on all cases simultaneously, performing 220% faster on an 8-node cluster than on a single node.

The method is based on our work focusing on high-grade glioma [39] , with further technical details available in [51] . The context sensitivity arises from two components in the framework. The first one is that the forest does not operate only on the original input images, but also on initial patient-specific probabilities for each tissue class . These probabilities are computed at test time for each patient as the posterior probability , based on the likelihood of the multi-channel intensity given . and are estimated based on the training dataset-the likelihood by a Gaussian mixture model, and the prior as a normalized empirical histogram. While the initial probabilities often give reasonable rough estimates, they are noisy and erroneous, due to use of local intensity information only. Presenting the initial estimates to the forest as additional input has the effect of removing the noise and correcting some misclassifications. The second context-inducing component is the use of context-sensitive features for the forest (similar to [132] , [133] ), which capture intensity characteristics around the point of interest. Due to the regularizing effect of the context-sensitive forest, we did not find it necessary to use an explicit energy-based regularization.",
