We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1",

Automated chest radiograph interpretation at the level of practicing radiologists could provide substantial benefit in many medical settings, from improved workflow prioritization and clinical decision support to large-scale screening and global population health initiatives. For progress, there is a need for labeled datasets that (1) are large, (2) have strong reference standards, and (3) provide expert human performance metrics for comparison.

The 'uncertain' label can capture both the uncertainty of a radiologist in the diagnosis as well as ambiguity inherent in the report (\"heart size is stable\"). The mention classification stage is a 3-phase pipeline consisting of pre-negation uncertainty, negation, and post-negation uncertainty. Each phase consists of rules which are matched against the mention; if a match is found, then the mention is classified accordingly (as uncertain in the first or third phase, and as negative in the second phase). If a mention is not matched in any of the phases, it is classified as positive. Rules for mention classification are designed on the universal dependency parse of the report. To obtain the universal dependency parse, we follow a procedure similar to Peng et al.(2018): first, the report is split and tokenized into sentences using NLTK (Bird, Klein, and Loper 2009) Table 2 : Performance of the labeler of NIH and our labeler on the report evaluation set on tasks of mention extraction, uncertainty detection, and negation detection, as measured by the F1 score.

For example, the following phrase \"cannot exclude pneumothorax.\" conveys uncertainty in the presence of pneumothorax. Without the pre-negation stage, the 'pneumothorax' match is classified as negative due to the 'exclude XXX' rule. However, by applying the 'cannot exclude' rule in the pre-negation stage, this observation can be correctly classified as uncertain.",

In contrast, the U-Ones approach performs worst on the Consolidation label, whereas the U-Zeros approach performs the best. We also note that Atelectasis and Consolidation are often mentioned together in radiology reports. For example, the phrase \"findings may represent atelectasis versus consolidation\" is very common.

On a test set with a strong ground truth, we find that our best model outperforms at least 2 of the 3 radiologists in the detection of 4 clinically relevant pathologies. We hope that the dataset will help development and validation of chest radiograph interpretation models towards improving healthcare access and delivery worldwide.",
