Scene understanding involves numerous tasks including recognizing what objects are present, localizing the objects in 2D and 3D, determining the objects' and scene's attributes, characterizing relationships between objects and providing a semantic description of the scene. The current object classification and detection datasets [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] help us explore the first challenges related to scene understanding. For instance the ImageNet dataset [1] , which contains an unprecedented number of images, has recently enabled breakthroughs in both object classification and detection research [5] , [6] , [7] . The community has also created datasets containing object attributes [8] , scene attributes [9] , keypoints [10] , and 3D scene information [11] . This leads us to the obvious question: what datasets will best continue our advance towards our ultimate goal of scene understanding?",

For many categories of objects, there exists an iconic view. For example, when performing a web-based image search for the object category \"bike,\" the top-ranked retrieved examples appear in profile, unobstructed near the center of a neatly composed photo. We posit that current recognition systems perform fairly well on iconic views, but struggle to recognize objects otherwise -in the We introduce a large, richly-annotated dataset comprised of images depicting complex everyday scenes of common objects in their natural context. background, partially occluded, amid clutter [13] -reflecting the composition of actual everyday scenes. We verify this experimentally; when evaluated on everyday scenes, models trained on our data perform better than those trained with prior datasets. A challenge is finding natural images that contain multiple objects. The identity of many objects can only be resolved using context, due to small size or ambiguous appearance in the image. To push research in contextual reasoning, images depicting scenes [3] rather than objects in isolation are necessary. Finally, we argue that detailed spatial understanding of object layout will be a core component of scene analysis. An object's spatial location can be defined coarsely using a bounding box [2] or with a precise pixel-level segmentation [14] , [15] , [16] . As we demonstrate, to measure either kind of localization performance it is essential for the dataset to have every instance of every object category labeled and fully segmented. Our dataset is unique in its annotation of instance-level segmentation masks, Fig. 1 .",

The early evolution of object recognition datasets [22] , [23] , [24] facilitated the direct comparison of hundreds of image recognition algorithms while simultaneously pushing the field towards more complex problems. Recently, the ImageNet dataset [1] containing millions of images has enabled breakthroughs in both object classification and detection research using a new class of deep learning algorithms [5] , [6] , [7] .

The PASCAL VOC [2] datasets contained 20 object categories spread over 11,000 images. Over 27,000 object instance bounding boxes were labeled, of which almost 7,000 had detailed segmentations. Recently, a detection challenge has been created from 200 object categories using a subset of 400,000 images from ImageNet [34] . An impressive 350,000 objects have been labeled using bounding boxes.",

That is, a few categories have a large number of instances (wall: 20,213, window: 16,080, chair: 7,971) while most have a relatively modest number of instances (boat: 349, airplane: 179, floor lamp: 276).

It has been shown that datasets containing more non-iconic images are better at generalizing [42] . We collected non-iconic images using two strategies. First as popularized by PASCAL VOC [2] , we collected images from Flickr which tends to have fewer iconic images. Flickr contains photos uploaded by amateur photographers with searchable metadata and keywords. Second, we did not search for object categories in isolation. A search for \"dog\" will tend to return iconic images of large, centered dogs. However, if we searched for pairwise combinations of object categories, such as \"dog + car\" we found many more non-iconic images. Surprisingly, these images typically do not just contain the two categories specified in the search, but numerous other categories as well. To further supplement our dataset we also searched for scene/object category pairs, see the appendix. We downloaded at most 5 photos taken by a single photographer within a short time window. In the rare cases in which enough images could not be found, we searched for single categories and performed an explicit filtering stage to remove iconic images. The result is a collection of 328,000 images with rich contextual relationships between objects as shown in Figs. 2(c) and 6.",

Since we have 91 categories and a large number of images, asking workers to answer 91 binary classification questions per image would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, we used a hierarchical approach [18] . We group the object categories into 11 super-categories (see the appendix). For a given image, a worker was presented with each group of categories in turn and asked to indicate whether any instances exist for that super-category. This greatly reduces the time needed to classify the various categories. For example, a worker may easily determine no animals are present in the image without having to specifically look for cats, dogs, etc. If a worker determines instances from the super-category (animal) are present, for each subordinate category (dog, cat, etc.) present, the worker must drag the category's icon onto the image over one instance of the category. The placement of these icons is critical for the following stage. We emphasize that only a single instance of each category needs to be annotated in this stage. To ensure high recall, 8 workers were asked to label each image. A category is considered present if any worker indicated the category; false positives are handled in subsequent stages. A detailed analysis of performance is presented in \u00a74.4. This stage took \u223c20k worker hours to complete.",

Such priming helped workers quickly find an initial instance upon first seeing the image. The workers could also use a magnifying glass to find small instances.

Many object detection algorithms benefit from additional annotations, such as the amount an instance is occluded [4] or the location of keypoints on the object [10] .

We then created an AMT filtering task that allowed users to remove invalid or iconic images from a grid of 128 candidates, Fig. 10 . We found the choice of instructions to be crucial, and so provided users with examples of iconic and non-iconic images. Some categories rarely co-occurred with others.

We group icons by the super-categories from Fig. 11 , allowing workers to quickly skip categories that are unlikely to be present.

The interface is initialized with a blinking icon specifying a single instance obtained from the previous category-labeling stage.

To aid the segmentation process, we added a visualization of the object category icon to remind workers of the category to be segmented. Crucially, we also added zoom-in functionality to allow for efficient annotation of small objects and curved boundaries. In the previous annotation stage, to ensure high coverage of all object instances, we used multiple workers to label all instances per image. We would like to segment all such object instances, but instance annotations across different workers may refer to different or redundant instances.

For this task we selected a subset of scene categories from the SUN dataset that frequently co-occurred with object categories of interest. Table enumerates the 40 scene categories (evenly split between indoor and outdoor scenes). Fig. 11 : Icons of 91 categories in the MS COCO dataset grouped by 11 super-categories. We use these icons in our annotation pipeline to help workers quickly reference the indicated object category. Fig. 12 : User interfaces for collecting instance annotations, see text for details. ",
