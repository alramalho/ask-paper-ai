    "abstract": "International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms. Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks.

In this context, a large amount of literature has been dedicated to the automatic analysis of medical images 4 . Semantic segmentation refers to the process of transforming raw medical images into clinically relevant, spatially structured information, such as outlining tumor boundaries, and is an essential prerequisite for a number of clinical applications, such as radiotherapy planning 5 and treatment response monitoring 6 . It is so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, with about 70% of all biomedical image analysis challenges dedicated to it 7 . With thousands of algorithms published in the field of biomedical image segmentation per year 8 , however, it has become challenging to decide on a baseline architecture as starting point when designing an algorithm for a new given clinical problem.",

Yet, a deep learning architecture well-suitable for a certain clinical problem (e.g., segmentation of brain tumors) may not necessarily generalize well to different, unseen tasks (e.g., vessel segmentation in the liver). Such a \"generalizable learner\", which in this setting would represent a fullyautomated method that can learn any segmentation task given some training data and without the need for human intervention, would provide the missing technical scalability to allow many new applications in computer-aided diagnosis, biomarker extraction, surgical intervention planning, disease prognosis, etc. To address this gap in the literature, we proposed the concept of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), an international challenge dedicated to identifying a generalpurpose algorithm for medical image segmentation. The competition comprised ten different data sets with various challenging characteristics, as shown in Fig. 1 . Two subsequent phases were presented to participants, first the development phase serving for model development and including seven open training data sets. Then, the mystery phase, aiming to investigate whether algorithms were able to generalize to three unseen segmentation tasks. During the mystery phase, participants were allowed to submit only one solution, able to solve all problems without changing the architecture or hyperparameters.",

It further applied a combination of augmentation strategies, namely affine transformation, non-linear deformation, intensity transformation (similar to gamma correction), mirroring along all axes and random crop.

For instance, the DSC metric is a good proxy for comparing large structures but should not be used intensively for very small objects, as single-pixel differences may already lead to substantial changes in the metric scores.

It is important to note that each task of the MSD data set comprised one to three different target ROIs, introducing a hierarchical structure within the data set. Starting from a significance ranking for each target ROI, we considered two different aggregation schemes: (1) averaging the significance ranks across all target ROIs; (2) averaging the significance ranks per task (data set) and averaging those per-task ranks for the final rank. The drawback of (1) is that a possible bias between tasks might be introduced, as tasks with multiple target ROIs (e.g., the brain task with three target ROIs) would be over-weighted. We therefore chose ranking scheme (2) to avoid this issue. This decision was made prior to the start of the challenge, as per the challenge statistical analysis protocol. A post-challenge analysis was performed to test this decision, and results found that overall ranking structure remained unchanged. The first three ranks were preserved, only minor changes (1 to 2 ranks) were seen in a couple of examples at the middle and end of the rank list. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 3-12 , changing the ranking scheme will typically lead to different rankings in the end, but we observed the first three ranks to be robust across various ranking variations. More complex ranking schemes were discussed among organizers, such as modeling the variations across tasks and target ROIs with a linear mixed model 24 . As explainability and a clear articulation of the ranking procedure was found to be important, it was ultimately decided to use significance ranking.",

Many challenge participants usually register to get data access. However, teams are often not able to submit their methods within the deadline due to other commitments. Furthermore, participants may be dissatisfied with their training and validation performance and step back from the final submission. The performance of the submitted algorithms varied dramatically across the different tasks, as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and Supplementary Tables 2-11 . For the development phase, the median algorithmic performance, defined as the median of the mean DSC, changed widely across tasks, with lowest being the tumor mass segmentation of the pancreas data set (0.21, Supplementary Table 7 ) and the highest median for the liver segmentation (0.94, Supplementary Table 5 ). The performance drop was much more modest for the best performing method nnU-Net (0.52 and 0.93 median DSC for the pancreas mass and liver ROI, respectively), demonstrating that methods have varying degrees of learning resiliency to the challenges posed by each task. The largest difference within one task was also obtained for the pancreas data set, with a median of the mean DSC of 0.69 for the pancreas ROI, and 0.21 for the pancreas tumor mass, which is likely explained by the very small relative intensity difference between the pancreas and its tumor mass.",

Similarly to the development phase, a much smaller drop in performance (0.56 and 0.96 for colon and spleen respectively) was observed in the top ranking method. Most of the observed task-specific performances reflect the natural difficulty and expected inter-rater variability of the tasks: Liver and spleen are large organs that are easy to detect and outline , whereas pancreas and colon cancers are much harder to segment as annotation experts themselves often do not agree on the correct outlines 29, 30 . We also observed that the challenging characteristics of each task (presented in Fig. 1 ) had some non-trivial effect on algorithmic performance, a problem which was exacerbated in lower-ranking methods. For example, some methods struggled to segment regions such as the lung cancer mass, pancreas mass, and colon cancer primaries, achieving a mean DSC below 0.1. These regions, characterized by small, non-obvious and heterogeneous masses, appear to represent a particularly challenging axis of algorithmic learning complexity. The number of subjects in the training data set (only 30 subjects for the heart task), the size and resolution of the images (large liver images and small hippocampus images), and complex region shapes (e.g., brain tumors) were not found to introduce significant inter-team performance differences. As summarized in Supplementary Fig. 13 , nnU-Net was ranked first on both the development and mystery phases. Under the proposed definition of a \"generalizable learner\", the winning method was found to be the most generalizable approach across all MSD tasks given the comparison methodology, with a significant performance margin. The K.A.V.athlon and NVDLMED teams were ranked second and third during the development phase, respectively; their ranks were swapped (third and second, respectively) during the mystery phase. We observed small changes in team rankings between the development and mystery phases for top ranking teams; within the top 8 teams, no team changed their ranking by more than 2 positions from the development to the mystery phase. This correlation between development and mystery rankings suggest limited amount of methodological overfitting to the development phase, and that the proposed ranking approach is a good surrogate of expected task performance. We observed some algorithmic commonalities between top methods, such the use of ensembles, intensity and spatial normalization augmentation, the use of Dice loss, the use of Adam as an optimizer, and some degree of post-processing (e.g., region removal). While none of these findings are surprising, they provide evidence towards a reasonable choice of initial parameters for new methodological developments. We also observed that the most commonly applied architecture across participants was the U-Net, used by 64% of teams. Some evidence was found that architectural adjustments to the baseline U-Net approach are less important than other relevant algorithmic design decisions, such as data augmentation and data set split/ cross-validation methodology, as demonstrated by the winning methodology. Note that similar findings, albeit in a different context and applied to ResNet, have been recently observed 31 .",

More specifically, both the third and the current (as of April 2021) leader of the rolling challenge used this approach. NAS optimizes the network architecture itself to each task in a fully-automated manner. Such an approach uses a network-configuration fitness function that is optimized independently for each task, thus providing an empirical approach for network architectural optimization.

The MSD challenge was set up to investigate how accurate fully-automated image segmentation learning methods can be on a plethora of tasks with different types of task complexity. Results from the MSD challenge have demonstrated that fully-automated methods can now achieve state-of-the-art performance without the need for manual parameter optimization, even when applied to previously unseen tasks. A central hypothesis of the MSD challenge-that an algorithm which works well and automatically on several tasks should also work well on other unseen tasks-has been validated among the challenge participants and across tasks. This hypothesis was further corroborated by monitoring the generalizability of the winning method in the 2 years following the challenge, where we found that nnU-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance on many tasks including against task-optimized networks. While it is important to note that many classic semantic segmentation problems (e.g., domain shift and label accuracy) remain, and that methodological progress (e.g., NAS and better heuristics) will continue pushing the boundaries of algorithmic performance and generalizability, the MSD challenge has demonstrated that the training of accurate semantic segmentation networks can now be fully automated. This commoditization of semantic segmentation methods allows computationally-versed scientists that lack AIspecific knowledge to use these techniques without any knowledge on how the models work or how to tune the hyperparameters. However, in order to make the tools easier to use by clinicians and other scientists, the current platforms would need to be wrapped around a graphical user interface and the installation processes need to be made simpler.",

The Decathlon challenge made ten data sets available online 35 , where each data set had between one and three region-of-interest (ROI) targets (17 targets in total). Importantly, all data sets have been released with a permissive copyright-license (CC-BY-SA 4.0), thus allowing for data sharing, redistribution, and commercial usage, and subsequently promoting the data set as a standard test-bed for all users. The images (2,633 in total) were acquired across multiple institutions, anatomies and modalities during real-world clinical applications. All images were de-identified and reformatted to the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov. All images were transposed (without resampling) to the most approximate rightanterior-superior coordinate frame, ensuring the data matrix x-y-z direction was consistent (using fslreorient2std) and converted to the NIFTI radiological standard. This data transformation was performed to minimize medical-imaging specific data loading issues for non-expert participants. Lastly, non-quantitative modalities (e.g., MRI) were robust min-max scaled to the same range. For each segmentation task, a pixel-level label annotation was provided depending on the definition of each specific task. Information on how the data sets were annotated is provided in 35 . For 8 out of 10 data sets, two thirds of the data were released as training sets (images and labels) and one third as test set (images without labels). As the remaining two tasks (brain tumor and liver) consisted of data from two wellknown challenges, the original training/test split was preserved. Note that interrater reliability estimates are not available for the MSD tasks due to the complexity of double-labeling the data, limiting comparisons to human (or super-human) level performance. Table 2 presents a summary of the ten data sets, including the modality, image series, ROI targets and data set size. A brief description of each data set is provided below.",

Brain: The data set consists of 750 multiparametric-magnetic resonance images (mp-MRI) from patients diagnosed with either glioblastoma or lower-grade glioma. The sequences used were native T1-weighted (T1), post-Gadolinium (Gd) contrast T1-weighted (T1-Gd), native T2weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). The corresponding target ROIs were the three tumor sub-regions, namely edema, enhancing, and non-enhancing tumor. This data set was selected due to the challenge of locating these complex and heterogeneously-located targets. The Brain data set contains the same cases as the 2016 and 2017 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenges [36] [37] [38] . The filenames were changed to avoid participants mapping cases between the two challenges. 2. Heart: The data set consists of 30 mono-modal MRI scans of the entire heart acquired during a single cardiac phase (free breathing with respiratory and electrocardiogram (ECG) gating). The corresponding target ROI was the left atrium. This data set was selected due to the combination of a small training data set with large anatomical variability. The data was acquired as part of the 2013 Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LASC) 39 . 3. Hippocampus: The data set consists of 195 MRI images acquired from 90 healthy adults and 105 adults with a non-affective psychotic disorder. T1-weighted MPRAGE was used as the imaging sequence. The corresponding target ROIs were the anterior and posterior of the hippocampus, defined as the hippocampus proper and parts of the subiculum. This data set was selected due to the precision needed to segment such a small object in the presence of a complex surrounding environment. The data was acquired at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, US. 4. Liver: The data set consists of 201 contrast-enhanced CT images from patients with primary cancers and metastatic liver disease, as a consequence of colorectal, breast, and lung primary cancers. The corresponding target ROIs were the segmentation of the liver and tumors inside the liver. This data set was selected due to the challenging nature of having significant label unbalance between large (liver) and small (tumor) target region of interests (ROIs). The data was acquired in the IRCAD H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires, Strasbourg, France and contained a subset of patients from the 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge 40 . 5. Lung: The data set consists of preoperative thin-section CT scans from 96 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The corresponding target ROI was the tumors within the lung. This data set was selected due to the challenge of segmenting small regions (tumor) in an image with a large field-of-view. Data was acquired via the Cancer Imaging.Archive (https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/). 6. Prostate: The data set consists of 48 prostate multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) studies comprising T2-weighted, Diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced series. A subset of two series, transverse T2-weighted and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was selected.",

Two widely known semantic segmentation metrics were used to evaluate the submitted approaches, namely the DSC and the Normalized Surface Distance (NSD) 10 , both computed on 3D volumes. The implementation of both metrics can be downloaded in the form of a Jupyter notebook from the challenge website, (http://www.medicaldecathlon.com section Assessment Criteria). A more memory-efficient recently implementation of the NSD metric, which has been recently made available, can be obtained by computing the distance transform map using (https://evalutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html# evalutils.stats.distance_transform_edt_float32) rather than scipy.ndimage. morphology.distance_transform_edt. The metrics DSC and NSD were chosen due to their popularity, rank stability 34 , and smooth, well-understood and well-defined behavior when ROIs do not overlap. Having simple and rank-stable metrics also allows the statistical comparison between methods. For the NSD,tolerance values were based on clinical feedback and consensus, and were chosen by the clinicians segmenting each organ. NSD was defined at task level and was the same for all the targets of each task. The value represented what they would consider an acceptable error for the segmentation they were performing. The following values have been mp-MRI multiparametric-magnetic resonance imaging, FLAIR fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T1w T1-weighted image, T1\\w Gd post-Gadolinium (Gd) contrast T1-weighted image, T2w T2-weighted image, CT computed tomography, PZ peripheral zone, TZ transition zone.",

It is important to note that the proposed metrics are not task-specific nor taskoptimal, and thus, they do not fulfill the necessary criteria for clinical algorithmic validation of each task, as discussed in \"Challenge assessment\".A so-called significance score was determined for each algorithm a, separately for each task/target ROI c i and metric m j \u2208 {DSC, NSD} and referred to as s i,j (a). Similarly to what was used to infer the ranking across the different BRATS tasks , the significance score was computed according to the following four-step process:1. Performance assessment per case: Determine performance m j (a l , t ik ) of all algorithms a l , with l = {1, \u2026, N A }, for all test cases t ik , with k = {1, \u2026, N i }, where N A is the number of competing algorithms and N i is the number of test cases in competition c i . Set m j (a l , t ik ) to 0 if its value is undefined. 2. Statistical tests: Perform a Wilcoxon signed-rank pairwise statistical test between algorithms \u00f0a l ; a l 0 \u00de, with values m j \u00f0a l ; t ik \u00de \u00c0 m j \u00f0a l 0 ; t ik \u00de, 8k = {1, . . . , N i }. 3. Significance scoring: s i,j (a l ) then equals the number of algorithms performing significantly worse than a l , according to the statistical test (per comparison \u03b1 = 0.05, not adjusted for multiplicity). 4. Significance ranking: The ranking is computed from the scores s i,j (a l ), with the highest score (rank 1) corresponding to the best algorithm. Note that shared scores/ranks are possible. If a task has multiple target ROI, the ranking scheme is applied to each ROI separately, and the final ranking per task is computed as the mean significance rank. The final score for each algorithm over all tasks of the development phase (the seven development tasks) and over all tasks of the mystery phase (the three mystery tasks) was computed as the average of the respective task's significance ranks. The full validation algorithm was defined and released prior to the start of the challenge, and available on the decathlon website (http://medicaldecathlon.com/files/MSD-Ranking-scheme.pdf).To investigate ranking uncertainty and stability, bootstrapping methods were applied with 1000 bootstrap samples as described in 34 . The statistical analysis was performed using the open-source R toolkit challengeR (https://phabricator.mitk. org/source/challenger/), version 1.0.2 17 , for analyzing and visualizing challenge results. The original rankings computed for the development and mystery phases were compared to the ranking lists based on the individual bootstrap samples. The correlation of pairwise rankings was determined via Kendall's \u03c4 18 , which provides values between \u22121 (for reverse ranking order) and 1 (for identical ranking order). The source code for generating the results presented in \"Results\" and the Appendix is publicly available (https://phabricator.mitk.org/source/msd_evaluation/).Monitoring of the challenge winner and algorithmic progress. To investigate our hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize its performance to an unseen task, and potentially even outperform a custom-designed task-specific solution, we monitored the winner of the challenge for a period of 2 years. Specifically, we reviewed the rank analysis and leaderboards presented in the corresponding article 8 , as well as the leaderboard of challenges from the grand-challenge.org website organized in 2020. We also reviewed further articles mentioning the new state-of-the-art method nnU-Net 19 . Finally, as the MSD challenge submission was reopened after the challenge event (denoted the \"MSD Live Challenge\"), we monitored submissions for new algorithmic approaches which achieve state-of-the-art performance, in order to probe new areas of scientific interest and development.Reporting summary.
