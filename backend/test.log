Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images. We took care to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43] ) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

We did not collect segmentations for the following 11 categories: hat, shoe, eyeglasses (too many instances), mirror, window, door, street sign (ambiguous and difficult to label), plate, desk (due to confusion with bowl and dining table, respectively) and blender, hair brush (too few instances). We may add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1

Extract into a markdown table the data characteristics of the datasets present in the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

These include ImageNet [1] , PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] , and SUN [3] . Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images. ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

The 2014 release contains 82,783 training, 40,504 validation, and 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test). There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Note that we have limited the 2014 release to a subset of 80 categories. We did not collect segmentations for the following 11 categories: hat, shoe, eyeglasses (too many instances), mirror, window, door, street sign (ambiguous and difficult to label), plate, desk (due to confusion with bowl and dining table, respectively) and blender, hair brush (too few instances). We may add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

- Dataset: Not specified 
- Characteristics:
    - Goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding.
    - Images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context
    - Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization
    - Contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old
    - 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images
    - Involved extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting, and instance segmentation
    - Detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN 
    - Baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

- Dataset: Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO)
- Characteristics:
    - Compared to several other popular datasets: ImageNet, PASCAL VOC 2012, and SUN
    - Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images
    - ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained
    - SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them
    - PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images
    - MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Number of instances per category for all 91 categories is shown in Fig. 5(a)
    - Summary of the datasets showing the number of object categories and the number of instances per category is shown in Fig. 5(d)
    - MS COCO has fewer categories than ImageNet and SUN, but has more instances per category which can be useful for learning complex models capable of precise localization.
    - In comparison to PASCAL VOC, MS COCO has both more categories and instances.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context
    - The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image.
    - For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled.
    - On average MS COCO dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image
    - In comparison, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average
    - Only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC.
    - SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

- Dataset: MS COCO and SUN
- Characteristics:
    - Analyze the average size of objects in the datasets
    - Generally smaller objects are harder to recognize and require more contextual reasoning to recognize
    - As shown in Fig. 5(e), the average sizes of objects is smaller for both MS COCO and SUN

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Split into two roughly equal parts:
        - First half of the dataset was released in 2014
        - Second half will be released in 2015
    - 2014 release contains:
        - 82,783 training images
        - 40,504 validation images
        - 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test)
        - Nearly 270k segmented people 
        - Total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone
    - 2015 release will contain:
        - 165,482 training images
        - 81,208 validation images
        - 81,434 testing images
    - Care was taken to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43]) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

- Dataset: Not specified
- Characteristics:
    - Following established protocol, annotations for train and validation data will be released, but not for test
    - Evaluation server for automatic evaluation on the test set is being finalized
    - A full discussion of evaluation metrics will be added once the evaluation server is complete.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - 2014 release is limited to a subset of 80 categories
    - The following 11 categories are not included: hat, shoe, eyeglasses, mirror, window, door, street sign, plate, desk, blender, hair brush 
        - Not collected segmentations for these categories because they are too many instances, ambiguous and difficult to label, due to confusion with other categories, or too few instances
    - May add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Next, we analyze the properties of the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset in comparison to several other popular datasets. These include ImageNet [1] , PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] , and SUN [3] . Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images. ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

A summary of the datasets showing the number of object categories and the number of instances per category is shown in Fig. 5(d) . While MS COCO has fewer categories than ImageNet and SUN, it has more instances per category which we hypothesize will be useful for learning complex models capable of precise localization. In comparison to PASCAL VOC, MS COCO has both more categories and instances.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: To accommodate a faster release schedule, we split the MS COCO dataset into two roughly equal parts. The first half of the dataset was released in 2014, the second half will be released in 2015. The 2014 release contains 82,783 training, 40,504 validation, and 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test). There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images. We took care to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43] ) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims "to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time. One active field of research consists in analyzing laparoscopic video data to provide context-aware Division of computer Assisted Medical interventions (cAMi), German cancer Research center (DKfZ), im neuenheimer Feld 223, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims "to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time. One active field of research consists in analyzing laparoscopic video data to provide context-aware Division of computer Assisted Medical interventions (cAMi), German cancer Research center (DKfZ), im neuenheimer Feld 223, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Typically, a challenge has a training phase. At the beginning of the training phase, the challenge organizers release training cases with the relevant reference annotations 6 . These help the participating teams in developing their method (e.g. by training a machine learning algorithm). In the test phase, the participating teams either upload their algorithm, or they receive access to the test cases without the reference annotations and submit the results that their algorithm has achieved for the test cases to the challenge organizers. To enable comparative benchmarking to be executed for this challenge paradigm, our data set was split into a training set and a test set. Our data set was arranged such that it allows for validation of detection/ binary segmentation/multi-instance segmentation algorithms in three test stages:

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: A limitation of our data set could be seen in the fact that the phase annotations were performed by only a single expert surgeon. It should be noted, however, that the phase annotations merely served as context information while the segmentations, which were generated with a highly quality-controlled process, are in the focus of this work. Furthermore, we acquired data from only one hospital. This implies limited variability with respect to the acquisition conditions as only one specific endoscope and light source were used. Still, to our knowledge, the HeiCo data set is the only publicly available data set (1) based on multiple different surgeries and (2) comprising not only annotated video data but also sensor data from medical devices in the operating room.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice.

The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research.

- Dataset: Not mentioned
- Characteristics:
    - Pre-processing:
        - Extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering)
        - The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in the dataset
        - Intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].

- Dataset: Not mentioned
- Characteristics:
    - Sliding-window prediction:
        - Formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task
        - A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion
        - Whole-volume CT scan is too large to fit in a regular GPU memory
        - Cropped 64x64x64 patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to the network
        - A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction
        - Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

- Dataset: Not mentioned
- Characteristics:
    - Post-processing:
        - Efficiently reduce the false positive in predictions
        - Predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out
        - Removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation
        - Generate detection proposal:
            - Binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1
            - Computed connected components on the binary segmentation
            - Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal
            - A probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims "to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time. One active field of research consists in analyzing laparoscopic video data to provide context-aware Division of computer Assisted Medical interventions (cAMi), German cancer Research center (DKfZ), im neuenheimer Feld 223, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Typically, a challenge has a training phase. At the beginning of the training phase, the challenge organizers release training cases with the relevant reference annotations 6 . These help the participating teams in developing their method (e.g. by training a machine learning algorithm). In the test phase, the participating teams either upload their algorithm, or they receive access to the test cases without the reference annotations and submit the results that their algorithm has achieved for the test cases to the challenge organizers. To enable comparative benchmarking to be executed for this challenge paradigm, our data set was split into a training set and a test set.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: A limitation of our data set could be seen in the fact that the phase annotations were performed by only a single expert surgeon. It should be noted, however, that the phase annotations merely served as context information while the segmentations, which were generated with a highly quality-controlled process, are in the focus of this work. Furthermore, we acquired data from only one hospital. This implies limited variability with respect to the acquisition conditions as only one specific endoscope and light source were used.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Image-based tracking of medical instruments is an integral part of surgical data science applications. Previous research has addressed the tasks of detecting, segmenting and tracking medical instruments based on laparoscopic video data. However, the proposed methods still tend to fail when applied to challenging images and do not generalize well to data they have not been trained on. This paper introduces the Heidelberg Colorectal (HeiCo) data set-the first publicly available data set enabling comprehensive benchmarking of medical instrument detection and segmentation algorithms with a specific emphasis on method robustness and generalization capabilities. Our data set comprises 30 laparoscopic videos and corresponding sensor data from medical devices in the operating room for three different types of laparoscopic surgery. Annotations include surgical phase labels for all video frames as well as information on instrument presence and corresponding instance-wise segmentation masks for surgical instruments (if any) in more than 10,000 individual frames. The data has successfully been used to organize international competitions within the Endoscopic Vision Challenges 2017 and 2019. Background & Summary Surgical data science was recently defined as an interdisciplinary research field which aims "to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value through the capture, organization, analysis and modelling of data" 1. The vision is to derive data science-based methodology to provide physicians with the right assistance at the right time. One active field of research consists in analyzing laparoscopic video data to provide context-aware Division of computer Assisted Medical interventions (cAMi), German cancer Research center (DKfZ), im neuenheimer Feld 223, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Typically, a challenge has a training phase. At the beginning of the training phase, the challenge organizers release training cases with the relevant reference annotations 6 . These help the participating teams in developing their method (e.g. by training a machine learning algorithm). In the test phase, the participating teams either upload their algorithm, or they receive access to the test cases without the reference annotations and submit the results that their algorithm has achieved for the test cases to the challenge organizers. To enable comparative benchmarking to be executed for this challenge paradigm, our data set was split into a training set and a test set. Our data set was arranged such that it allows for validation of detection/ binary segmentation/multi-instance segmentation algorithms in three test stages:

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative assessment of image analysis algorithms. Although segmentation is the most widely investigated medical image processing task, the various challenges have been organized to focus only on specific clinical tasks. We organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)-a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities to investigate the hypothesis that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a customdesigned solution. MSD results confirmed this hypothesis, moreover, MSD winner continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems for the next two years. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to scientists that are not versed in AI model training.

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low-and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

The images represent a mix of pre-and post-therapy brain scans, with two volumes showing resections. They were acquired at four different centers-Bern University, Debrecen University, Heidelberg University, and Massachusetts General Hospital-over the course of several years, using MR scanners from different vendors and with different field strengths (1.5T and 3T) and implementations of the imaging sequences (e.g., 2D or 3D). The image datasets used in the study all share the following four MRI contrasts (Fig. 2) . 1) T1: T1-weighted, native image, sagittal or axial 2D acquisitions, with 1-6 mm slice thickness. 2) T1c: T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium) image, with 3D acquisition and 1 mm isotropic voxel size for most patients. 3) T2: T2-weighted image, axial 2D acquisition, with 2-6 mm slice thickness. 4) FLAIR: T2-weighted FLAIR image, axial, coronal, or sagittal 2D acquisitions, 2-6 mm slice thickness. To homogenize these data we co-registered each subject's image volumes rigidly to the T1c MRI, which had the highest spatial resolution in most cases, and resampled all images to 1 mm isotropic resolution in a standardized axial orientation with a linear interpolator. We used a rigid registration model with the mutual information similarity metric as it is implemented in ITK [74] ("VersorRigid3DTransform" with "MattesMutualInformation" similarity metric and three multi-resolution levels).

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: In this paper we report the setup and results of the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2012 and conferences. Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low-and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.

The image datasets used in the study all share the following four MRI contrasts (Fig. 2) . 1) T1: T1-weighted, native image, sagittal or axial 2D acquisitions, with 1-6 mm slice thickness. 2) T1c: T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced (Gadolinium) image, with 3D acquisition and 1 mm isotropic voxel size for most patients. 3) T2: T2-weighted image, axial 2D acquisition, with 2-6 mm slice thickness. 4) FLAIR: T2-weighted FLAIR image, axial, coronal, or sagittal 2D acquisitions, 2-6 mm slice thickness. To homogenize these data we co-registered each subject's image volumes rigidly to the T1c MRI, which had the highest spatial resolution in most cases, and resampled all images to 1 mm isotropic resolution in a standardized axial orientation with a linear interpolator. We used a rigid registration model with the mutual information similarity metric as it is implemented in ITK [74] ("VersorRigid3DTransform" with "MattesMutualInformation" similarity metric and three multi-resolution levels). No attempt was made to put the individual patients in a common reference space. All images were skull stripped [75] to guarantee anomymization of the patients.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: The emergence of deep learning has considerably advanced the state-of-the-art in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) segmentation. Many techniques have been proposed over the last few years, bringing the accuracy of automated segmentation close to human performance. However, these models have been all too often trained and validated using cardiac imaging samples from single clinical centres or homogeneous imaging protocols. This has prevented the development and validation of models that are generalizable across different clinical centres, imaging conditions or scanner vendors. To promote further research and scientific benchmarking in the field of generalizable deep learning for cardiac segmentation, this paper presents the results of the Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation (M&Ms) Challenge, which was recently organized as part of the MICCAI 2020 Conference. A total of 14 teams submitted different solutions to the problem, combining various baseline models, data augmentation strategies, and domain adaptation techniques. The obtained results indicate the importance of intensity-driven data augmentation, as well as the need for further research to improve generalizability towards unseen scanner vendors or new imaging protocols. Furthermore, we present a new resource of 375 heterogeneous CMR datasets acquired by using four different scanner vendors in six hospitals and three different countries (Spain, Canada and Germany), which we provide as open-access for the community to enable future research in the field.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Asked text: 
Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

The first half of the dataset was released in 2014, the second half will be released in 2015. The 2014 release contains 82,783 training, 40,504 validation, and 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test). There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.

These include ImageNet [1] , PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] , and SUN [3] . Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images. ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

    - SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.

- Dataset: MS COCO and SUN
- Characteristics:
    - Analyze the average size of objects in the datasets
    - Generally smaller objects are harder to recognize and require more contextual reasoning to recognize
    - As shown in Fig. 5(e), the average sizes of objects is smaller for both MS COCO and SUN

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - Split into two roughly equal parts:
        - First half of the dataset was released in 2014
        - Second half will be released in 2015
    - 2014 release contains:
        - 82,783 training images
        - 40,504 validation images
        - 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test)
        - Nearly 270k segmented people 
        - Total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone
    - 2015 release will contain:
        - 165,482 training images
        - 81,208 validation images
        - 81,434 testing images
    - Care was taken to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43]) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.

- Dataset: Not specified
- Characteristics:
    - Following established protocol, annotations for train and validation data will be released, but not for test
    - Evaluation server for automatic evaluation on the test set is being finalized
    - A full discussion of evaluation metrics will be added once the evaluation server is complete.

- Dataset: MS COCO
- Characteristics:
    - 2014 release is limited to a subset of 80 categories
    - The following 11 categories are not included: hat, shoe, eyeglasses, mirror, window, door, street sign, plate, desk, blender, hair brush 
        - Not collected segmentations for these categories because they are too many instances, ambiguous and difficult to label, due to confusion with other categories, or too few instances
    - May add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.

Extract the datasets and their characteristics in a nested list manner from the following text: (c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.
(c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.Next, we analyze the properties of the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset in comparison to several other popular datasets. These include ImageNet [1] , PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] , and SUN [3] . Each of these datasets varies significantly in size, list of labeled categories and types of images. ImageNet was created to capture a large number of object categories, many of which are fine-grained. SUN focuses on labeling scene types and the objects that commonly occur in them. Finally, PASCAL VOC's primary application is object detection in natural images. MS COCO is designed for the detection and segmentation of objects occurring in their natural context.
The number of instances per category for all 91 categories is shown in Fig. 5(a) . A summary of the datasets showing the number of object categories and the number of instances per category is shown in Fig. 5(d) . While MS COCO has fewer categories than ImageNet and SUN, it has more instances per category which we hypothesize will be useful for learning complex models capable of precise localization. In comparison to PASCAL VOC, MS COCO has both more categories and instances.
An important property of our dataset is we strive to find non-iconic images containing objects in their natural context. The amount of contextual information present in an image can be estimated by examining the average number of object categories and instances per image, Fig. 5(b, c) . For ImageNet we plot the object detection validation set, since the training data only has a single object labeled. On average our dataset contains 3.5 categories and 7.7 instances per image. In comparison ImageNet and PASCAL VOC both have less than 2 categories and 3 instances per image on average. Another interesting observation is only 10% of the images in MS COCO have only one category per image, in comparison, over 60% of images contain a single object category in ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. As expected, the SUN dataset has the most contextual information since it is scene-based and uses an unrestricted set of categories.
Finally, we analyze the average size of objects in the datasets. Generally smaller objects are harder to recognize and require more contextual reasoning to recognize. As shown in Fig. 5(e) , the average sizes of objects is smaller for both MS COCO and SUN.
To accommodate a faster release schedule, we split the MS COCO dataset into two roughly equal parts. The first half of the dataset was released in 2014, the second half will be released in 2015. The 2014 release contains 82,783 training, 40,504 validation, and 40,775 testing images (approximately 1 train, 1 val, and 1 test). There are nearly 270k segmented people and a total of 886k segmented object instances in the 2014 train+val data alone. The cumulative 2015 release will contain a total of 165,482 train, 81,208 val, and 81,434 test images. We took care to minimize the chance of near-duplicate images existing across splits by explicitly removing near duplicates (detected with [43] ) and grouping images by photographer and date taken.
Following established protocol, annotations for train and validation data will be released, but not for test. We are currently finalizing the evaluation server for automatic evaluation on the test set. A full discussion of evaluation metrics will be added once the evaluation server is complete.
Note that we have limited the 2014 release to a subset of 80 categories. We did not collect segmentations for the following 11 categories: hat, shoe, eyeglasses (too many instances), mirror, window, door, street sign (ambiguous and difficult to label), plate, desk (due to confusion with bowl and dining table, respectively) and blender, hair brush (too few instances). We may add segmentations for some of these categories in the cumulative 2015 release.

Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1CheXpert is a large public dataset for chest radiograph interpretation, consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain. We report the prevalences of the labels for the different obsevations in Table 1 .
We retrospectively collected chest radiographic studies from Stanford Hospital, performed between October 2002 and July 2017 in both inpatient and outpatient centers, along with their associated radiology reports. From these, we sampled a set of 1000 reports for manual review by a boardcertified radiologist to determine feasibility for extraction of observations. We decided on 14 observations based on the prevalence in the reports and clinical relevance, conforming to the Fleischner Society's recommended glossary (Hansell et al. 2008 ) whenever applicable. "Pneumonia", despite being a clinical diagnosis, was included as a label in order to represent the images that suggested primary infection as the diagnosis. The "No Finding" observation was intended to capture the absence of all pathologies.
1. unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette 2. diffuse reticular pattern, which can be seen with an atypical infection or chronic fibrotic change. no focal consolidation.
3. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax 4. mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and old right rib fractures. Figure 2 : Output of the labeler when run on a report sampled from our dataset. In this case, the labeler correctly extracts all of the mentions in the report (underline) and classifies the uncertainties (bolded) and negations (italicized).
One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.
The most commonly used benchmark for developing chest radiograph interpretation models has been the ChestX-ray14 dataset . Due to the introduction of this large dataset, substantial progress has been made towards developing automated chest radiograph interpretation models (Yao et al. 2017; Rajpurkar et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017b; Kumar, Grewal, and Srivastava 2018; Guan et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018) . However, using the NIH dataset as a benchmark on which to compare models is problematic as the labels in the test set are extracted from reports using an automatic labeler. The CheXpert dataset that we introduce features radiologist-labeled validation and test sets which serve as strong reference standards, as well as expert scores to allow for robust evaluation of different algorithms.

Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee of Huadong Hospital affiliated to Fudan University (NO.2019K146), which waived the requirement for informed consent.
The chest-abdomen CT DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format images were imported into the software for delineating, and the images with VOI information were then extracted with NII or NIFTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format for next-step analysis.
As depicted in Table 1 , we randomly split the whole RibFrac Dataset (900 cases, 332,483 CT slices in total) into 3 cohorts: training (720 cases, to train the deep learning system), tuning (60 cases, to tune hyper-parameters of the deep learning system) and test (120 cases, to evaluate the model and human performance). In standard machine learning terminology, tuning is regarded as "validation"; in standard medical terminology, test in regarded as "validation".
Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.
(a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].
(b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.
(c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1CheXpert is a large public dataset for chest radiograph interpretation, consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain. We report the prevalences of the labels for the different obsevations in Table 1 .
We retrospectively collected chest radiographic studies from Stanford Hospital, performed between October 2002 and July 2017 in both inpatient and outpatient centers, along with their associated radiology reports. From these, we sampled a set of 1000 reports for manual review by a boardcertified radiologist to determine feasibility for extraction of observations. We decided on 14 observations based on the prevalence in the reports and clinical relevance, conforming to the Fleischner Society's recommended glossary (Hansell et al. 2008 ) whenever applicable. "Pneumonia", despite being a clinical diagnosis, was included as a label in order to represent the images that suggested primary infection as the diagnosis. The "No Finding" observation was intended to capture the absence of all pathologies.
1. unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette 2. diffuse reticular pattern, which can be seen with an atypical infection or chronic fibrotic change. no focal consolidation.
3. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax 4. mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and old right rib fractures. Figure 2 : Output of the labeler when run on a report sampled from our dataset. In this case, the labeler correctly extracts all of the mentions in the report (underline) and classifies the uncertainties (bolded) and negations (italicized).
One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.
The most commonly used benchmark for developing chest radiograph interpretation models has been the ChestX-ray14 dataset . Due to the introduction of this large dataset, substantial progress has been made towards developing automated chest radiograph interpretation models (Yao et al. 2017; Rajpurkar et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017b; Kumar, Grewal, and Srivastava 2018; Guan et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018) . However, using the NIH dataset as a benchmark on which to compare models is problematic as the labels in the test set are extracted from reports using an automatic labeler. The CheXpert dataset that we introduce features radiologist-labeled validation and test sets which serve as strong reference standards, as well as expert scores to allow for robust evaluation of different algorithms.

We identify label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets, and subsequently study the potential for these label errors to affect benchmark results. Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of at least 3.3% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (51% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled, on average across the datasets). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy-our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on Ima-geNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 5%.Here we summarize our algorithmic label error identification performed prior to crowd-sourced human verification. An overview of each dataset and any modifications is detailed in Appendix A.
Step-bystep instructions to obtain each dataset and reproduce the label errors for each dataset are provided at https://github.com/cleanlab/label-errors. Our code relies on the implementation of confident learning open-sourced at https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab. The primary contribution of this section is not in the methodology, which is covered extensively in Northcutt et al. [33] , but in its utilization as a filtering process to significantly (often as much as 90%) reduce the number of examples requiring human validation in the next step.
To identify label errors in a test dataset with n examples and m classes, we first characterize label noise in the dataset using the confident learning (CL) framework [33] [47] . Table 1 shows the number of CL-guessed label errors for each test set in our study. CL estimation of Qỹ ,y * is summarized in Appendix C.
Computing out-of-sample predicted probabilities Estimating Qỹ ,y * for CL noise characterization requires two inputs for each dataset: (1) out-of-sample predicted probabilitiesP k,i (n×m matrix) and
(2) the test set labelsỹ k . We observe the best results computingP k,i by pre-training on the train set, then fine-tuning (all layers) on the test set using cross-validation to ensureP k,i is out-of-sample. If pre-trained models are open-sourced (e.g. ImageNet), we use them instead of pre-training ourselves. If the dataset did not have an explicit test set (e.g. QuickDraw and Amazon Reviews), we skip pre-training and computeP k,i using cross-validation on the entire dataset. For all datasets, we try common models that achieve reasonable accuracy with minimal hyper-parameter tuning and use the model yielding the highest cross-validation accuracy, reported in Table 1 .
Using this approach allows us to find label errors without manually checking the entire test set, because CL identifies potential label errors automatically. 
Finally, we consider how pervasive test set label errors may affect ML practitioners in real-world applications. To clarify the discussion, we first introduce some useful terminology.
Definition 1 (original accuracy,Ã). The accuracy of a model's predicted labels over a given dataset, computed with respect to the original labels present in the dataset. MeasuringÃ over the test set is the standard way practitioners evaluate their models today. Definition 2 (corrected accuracy, A * ). The accuracy of a model's predicted labels, computed over a modified dataset in which previously identified erroneous labels have been corrected by humans to the true class when possible and removed when not. Measuring A * over the test set is preferable tõ A for evaluating models because A * better reflects performance in real-world applications.
The human labelers referenced throughout this section are the workers from our MTurk study in Section 4. In the following definitions, \ denotes a set difference and D denotes the full test dataset. These definitions imply B, C, U are disjoint with D = B ∪ C ∪ U and also P = B ∪ C. In subsequent experiments, we report corrected test accuracy over P after correcting all of the labels in C ⊂ P.
We ignore the unknown-label set U (and do not include those examples in our estimate of noise prevalence) because it is unclear how to measure corrected accuracy for examples whose true underlying label remains ambiguous. Thus the noise prevalence reported throughout this section differs from the fraction of label errors originally found in each of the test sets.
A major issue in ML today is that one only sees the original test accuracy in practice, whereas one would prefer to base modeling decisions on the corrected test accuracy instead. Our subsequent discussion highlights the potential implications of this mismatch. What are the consequences of test set label errors? Figure 3 compares performance on the ImageNet validation set, commonly used in place of the test set, of 34 pre-trained models from the PyTorch and Keras repositories (throughout, we use provided checkpoints of models that have been fit to the original training set). Figure 3a confirms the observations of Recht et al. [37] ; benchmark conclusions are largely unchanged by using a corrected test set, i.e. in our case by removing errors.
For our study, we select 10 of the most-cited, open-source datasets created in the last 20 years from the Wikipedia List of ML Research Datasets [26] , with preference for diversity across computer vision, NLP, sentiment analysis, and audio modalities. Citation counts were obtained via the Microsoft Cognitive API. In total, we evaluate six visual datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, ImageNet, and QuickDraw; three text datasets: 20news, IMDB, and Amazon Reviews; and one audio dataset: AudioSet.
For each of the datasets we investigate, we summarize the original data collection and labeling procedure as they pertain to potential label errors.
MNIST [22] . MNIST is a database of binary images of handwritten digits. The dataset was constructed from Handwriting Sample Forms distributed to Census Bureau employees and high school students; the ground-truth labels were determined by matching digits to the instructions of the task to copy a particular set of digits [11] . Label errors may arise from failure to follow instructions or from handwriting ambiguities.
CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 [21] . The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are collections of small 32 × 32 images and labels from a set of 10 or 100 classes, respectively. The images were collected by searching the internet for the class label. Human labelers were instructed to select images that matched their class label (query term) by filtering out mislabeled images. Images were intended to only have one prominent instance of the object, but could be partially occluded as long as it was identifiable to the labeler.
Caltech-256 [10] . Caltech-256 is a database of images sorted into 256 classes, plus an extra class called "clutter". Images were scraped from image search engines. Four human labelers were instructed to rate the images into "good," "bad," and "not applicable," eliminating the images that were confusing, occluded, cluttered, artistic, or not an example of the object category from the dataset. Because no explicit test set is provided, we study label errors in the entire dataset to ensure coverage of any test set split used by practitioners. Modifications: In our study, we ignore data with the ambiguous "clutter" label (class 257) and consider only the images labeled class 1 to class 256.
ImageNet [6] . ImageNet is a database of images belonging to one of 1,000 classes. Images were scraped by querying words from WordNet "synonym sets" (synsets) on several image search engines. The images were labeled by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who were asked whether each image contains objects of a particular given synset. Workers were instructed to select images that contain objects of a given subset regardless of occlusions, number of objects, and clutter to "ensure diversity" in the dataset's images.
QuickDraw [12] . The Quick, Draw! dataset contains more than 1 billion doodles collected from users of an experimental game to benchmark image classification models. Users were instructed to draw pictures corresponding to a given label, but the drawings may be "incomplete or may not match the label." Because no explicit test set is provided, we study label errors in the entire dataset to ensure coverage of any test set split used by practitioners.
20news [30] . The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of articles posted to Usenet newsgroups used to benchmark text classification and clustering models. The label for each example is the newsgroup it was originally posted in (e.g. "misc.forsale"), so it is obtained during the overall data collection procedure.
IMDB [27] . The IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset is a collection of movie reviews to benchmark binary sentiment classification. The labels were determined by the user's review: a score ≤ 4 out of 10 is considered negative; ≥ 7 out of 10 is considered positive.
Amazon Reviews [29] . The Amazon Reviews dataset is a collection of textual reviews and 5-star ratings from Amazon customers used to benchmark sentiment analysis models. We use the 5-core (9.9 GB) variant of the dataset. Modifications: In our study, 2-star and 4-star reviews are removed due to ambiguity with 1-star and 5-star reviews, respectively. If these reviews were left in the dataset, they could inflate error counts. Because no explicit test set is provided, we study label errors in the entire dataset to ensure coverage of any test set split used by practitioners.
AudioSet [8] . AudioSet is a collection of 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos and multiple labels describing the sounds that are present in the clip. Three human labelers independently rated the presence of one or more labels (as "present," "not present," and "unsure"), and majority agreement was required to assign a label. The authors note that spot checking revealed some label errors due to "confusing labels, human error, and difference in detection of faint/non-salient audio events."
Here we provide some additional details/results to complement Section from the main text. Figure  3 depicts how the benchmarking rankings on the correctable subset of ImageNet examples change significantly for an agreement threshold = 5, meaning 5 of 5 human raters need to independently select the same alternative label for that data point and a new label to be included in the accuracy evaluation. To ascertain that the results of this figure are not due to the setting of the agreement threshold, the results for all three settings of the agreement threshold are shown in Sub-figure S3b. Observe the negative correlation (for top-1 accuracy) occurs in all three settings. Furthermore, observe that this negative correlation no longer holds when top-5 accuracy is used (shown in S3a), likely because many of these models use a loss which maximizes (and overfits to noise) based on top-1 accuracy, not top-5 accuracy. Regardless of whether top-1 or top-5 accuracy is used, model benchmark rankings change significantly on the correctable set in comparison to the original test set (see Table S1 ).

Background: Diagnosis of rib fractures plays an important role in identifying trauma severity. However, quickly and precisely identifying the rib fractures in a large number of CT images with increasing number of patients is a tough task, which is also subject to the qualification of radiologist. We aim at a clinically applicable automatic system for rib fracture detection and segmentation from CT scans. Methods: A total of 7,473 annotated traumatic rib fractures from 900 patients in a single center were enrolled into our dataset, named RibFrac Dataset, which were annotated with a human-in-the-loop labeling procedure. We developed a deep learning model, named FracNet, to detect and segment rib fractures. 720, 60 and 120 patients were randomly split as training cohort, tuning cohort and test cohort, respectively. Free-Response ROC (FROC) analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positives of the detection performance, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (Dice) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance of predicted rib fractures. Observer studies, including independent human-only study and human-collaboration study, were used to benchmark the FracNet with human performance and evaluate its clinical applicability. A annotated subset of RibFrac Dataset, including 420 for training, 60 for tuning and 120 for test, as well as our code for model training and evaluation, was open to research community to facilitate both clinical and engineering research. Findings: Our method achieved a detection sensitivity of 92.9% with 5.27 false positives per scan and a segmentation Dice of 71.5%on the test cohort. Human experts achieved much lower false positives per scan, while underperforming the deep neural networks in terms of detection sensitivities with longer time in diagnosis. With human-computer collobration, human experts achieved higher detection sensitivities than human-only or computer-only diagnosis. Interpretation: The proposed FracNet provided increasing detection sensitivity of rib fractures with significantly decreased clinical time consumed, which established a clinically applicable method to assist the radiologist in clinical practice. Funding: A full list of funding bodies that contributed to this study can be found in the Acknowledgements section. The funding sources played no role in the study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or decision to submit the article for publication .This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee of Huadong Hospital affiliated to Fudan University (NO.2019K146), which waived the requirement for informed consent.
The chest-abdomen CT DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format images were imported into the software for delineating, and the images with VOI information were then extracted with NII or NIFTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format for next-step analysis.
As depicted in Table 1 , we randomly split the whole RibFrac Dataset (900 cases, 332,483 CT slices in total) into 3 cohorts: training (720 cases, to train the deep learning system), tuning (60 cases, to tune hyper-parameters of the deep learning system) and test (120 cases, to evaluate the model and human performance). In standard machine learning terminology, tuning is regarded as "validation"; in standard medical terminology, test in regarded as "validation".
Considering several practical issues, we open source a subset of 600 cases (221,308 CT slices in total), with 420 cases for training, 60 cases for tuning and 120 for test. To our knowledge, it is the first open research dataset in this application. On the open-source subset of RibFrac Dataset, a deep learning system with same architecture of FracNet could be developed and validated with an acceptable performance. Please refer to Supplementary Materials for details. Our algorithm follows a data-driven approach: it relies on the human annotations of rib fractures and learns to directly predict the voxel-level segmentation of fractures. Notably, the proposed FracNet does not rely on the extraction of rib centerlines in typical rib analysis algorithms [27] . As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) , our model pipeline consists of three stages: (a) pre-processing, (b) sliding-window prediction, and (c) post-processing.
(a) Pre-processing: To speed up the detection, we extracted the bone areas through a series of morphological operations (e.g., thresholding and filtering). The original spacing was preserved since only thin-section CT scans were included in our dataset. The intensity of input voxels was clipped to the bone window (level=450, width=1100) and normalized to [-1,1].
(b) Sliding-window prediction: Considering the elongated shape of rib fractures, standard labeling with bounding boxes could be missing much details. Therefore, we formulated the rib fracture detection as a 3D segmentation task. A customized 3D UNet, named FracNet (Section 2.2.2.), was developed to perform segmentation in a sliding-window fashion. Since a whole-volume CT scan could be too large to fit in a regular GPU memory, we cropped 64 Â 64 Â 64patches in a sliding-window fashion with a stride of 48 and feed them to our network. A raw segmentation was obtained by assembling patches of prediction. Maximum values were kept in the overlapping regions of multiple predictions.
(c) Post-processing: To efficiently reduce the false positive in our predictions, predictions of small sizes (smaller than 200 voxels) were filtered out. We also removed the spine regions according to their coordinates on the raw segmentation. To generate detection proposal, we first binarized the post-processed segmentation results with a low threshold of 0.1, and then computed connected components on the binary segmentation. Each connected component was regarded as a detection proposal, with a probability calculated by averaging raw segmentation scores over all voxels within the connected component.

Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1CheXpert is a large public dataset for chest radiograph interpretation, consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain. We report the prevalences of the labels for the different obsevations in Table 1 .
We retrospectively collected chest radiographic studies from Stanford Hospital, performed between October 2002 and July 2017 in both inpatient and outpatient centers, along with their associated radiology reports. From these, we sampled a set of 1000 reports for manual review by a boardcertified radiologist to determine feasibility for extraction of observations.

In this case, the labeler correctly extracts all of the mentions in the report (underline) and classifies the uncertainties (bolded) and negations (italicized).
One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.
The most commonly used benchmark for developing chest radiograph interpretation models has been the ChestX-ray14 dataset . Due to the introduction of this large dataset, substantial progress has been made towards developing automated chest radiograph interpretation models (Yao et al. 2017; Rajpurkar et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017b; Kumar, Grewal, and Srivastava 2018; Guan et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018) . However, using the NIH dataset as a benchmark on which to compare models is problematic as the labels in the test set are extracted from reports using an automatic labeler. The CheXpert dataset that we introduce features radiologist-labeled validation and test sets which serve as strong reference standards, as well as expert scores to allow for robust evaluation of different algorithms.

I want you to summarize the whole text into a markdown table that represents the characterstics of all the datasets. The resulting table should be easy to read and contain any information that might be useful for medical researchers thinking about using any of those datasets. Some example fields would be "Name", "Size", "Demographic information", "Origin" and "Data or code link to find more", but add as many as you think are relevant for a medical researcher. The resulting table should contain as many entries as possible but it should NOT contain any duplicates (columns with the same "Name" field) and it should NOT contain any entries where the "Name" field is not defined/unknown/ not specified.
Start context
Large, labeled datasets have driven deep learning methods to achieve expert-level performance on a variety of medical imaging tasks. We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models. 1CheXpert is a large public dataset for chest radiograph interpretation, consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain. We report the prevalences of the labels for the different obsevations in Table 1 .
We retrospectively collected chest radiographic studies from Stanford Hospital, performed between October 2002 and July 2017 in both inpatient and outpatient centers, along with their associated radiology reports. From these, we sampled a set of 1000 reports for manual review by a boardcertified radiologist to determine feasibility for extraction of observations. We decided on 14 observations based on the prevalence in the reports and clinical relevance, conforming to the Fleischner Society's recommended glossary (Hansell et al. 2008 ) whenever applicable. "Pneumonia", despite being a clinical diagnosis, was included as a label in order to represent the images that suggested primary infection as the diagnosis. The "No Finding" observation was intended to capture the absence of all pathologies.
1. unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette 2. diffuse reticular pattern, which can be seen with an atypical infection or chronic fibrotic change. no focal consolidation.
3. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax 4. mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and old right rib fractures. Figure 2 : Output of the labeler when run on a report sampled from our dataset. In this case, the labeler correctly extracts all of the mentions in the report (underline) and classifies the uncertainties (bolded) and negations (italicized).
One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.
The most commonly used benchmark for developing chest radiograph interpretation models has been the ChestX-ray14 dataset . Due to the introduction of this large dataset, substantial progress has been made towards developing automated chest radiograph interpretation models (Yao et al. 2017; Rajpurkar et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017b; Kumar, Grewal, and Srivastava 2018; Guan et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018) . However, using the NIH dataset as a benchmark on which to compare models is problematic as the labels in the test set are extracted from reports using an automatic labeler. The CheXpert dataset that we introduce features radiologist-labeled validation and test sets which serve as strong reference standards, as well as expert scores to allow for robust evaluation of different algorithms.

1. unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette 2. diffuse reticular pattern, which can be seen with an atypical infection or chronic fibrotic change. no focal consolidation.
3. no pleural effusion or pneumothorax 4. mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and old right rib fractures. Figure 2 : Output of the labeler when run on a report sampled from our dataset. In this case, the labeler correctly extracts all of the mentions in the report (underline) and classifies the uncertainties (bolded) and negations (italicized).
One of the main obstacles in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models has been the lack of datasets with strong radiologist-annotated groundtruth and expert scores against which researchers can compare their models. There are few chest radiographic imaging datasets that are publicly available, but none of them have test sets with strong ground truth or radiologist performances. The Indiana Network for Patient Care hosts the OpenI dataset (Demner-Fushman et al. 2015) consisting of 7,470 frontal-view radiographs and radiology reports which have been labeled with key findings by human annotators . The National Cancer Institute hosts the PLCO Lung dataset (Gohagan et al. 2000) of chest radiographs obtained during a study on lung cancer screening . The dataset contains 185,421 full resolution images, but due to the nature of the collection process, it is has a low prevalence of clinically important pathologies such as Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Effusion, and Cardiomegaly. The MIMIC-CXR dataset (Rubin et al. 2018) has been recently announced but is not yet publicly available.
The most commonly used benchmark for developing chest radiograph interpretation models has been the ChestX-ray14 dataset . Due to the introduction of this large dataset, substantial progress has been made towards developing automated chest radiograph interpretation models (Yao et al. 2017; Rajpurkar et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017b; Kumar, Grewal, and Srivastava 2018; Guan et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018) . However, using the NIH dataset as a benchmark on which to compare models is problematic as the labels in the test set are extracted from reports using an automatic labeler. The CheXpert dataset that we introduce features radiologist-labeled validation and test sets which serve as strong reference standards, as well as expert scores to allow for robust evaluation of different algorithms.
