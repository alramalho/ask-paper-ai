{"Please answer the following request, denoted by \"Request:\" in the best way possible with the given context that bounded by \"Start context\" and \"End context\".Request: Please summarize the following text on a markdown table. The text will contain possibly repeated information about the charactersitics of one or more datasets. I want you to summarize the whole text into a markdown table that represents the characterstics of all the datasets. The resulting table should be easy to read and contain any information that might be useful for medical researchers thinking about using any of those datasets. Some example fields would be \"Name\", \"Size\", \"Demographic information\", \"Origin\" and \"Data or code link to find more\", but add as many as you think are relevant for a medical researcher. The resulting table should contain as many entries as possible but it should NOT contain any duplicates (columns with the same \"Name\" field) and it should NOT contain any entries where the \"Name\" field is not defined/unknown/ not specified.\nStart context\nThe emergence of deep learning has considerably advanced the state-of-the-art in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) segmentation. Many techniques have been proposed over the last few years, bringing the accuracy of automated segmentation close to human performance. However, these models have been all too often trained and validated using cardiac imaging samples from single clinical centres or homogeneous imaging protocols. This has prevented the development and validation of models that are generalizable across different clinical centres, imaging conditions or scanner vendors. To promote further research and scientific benchmarking in the field of generalizable deep learning for cardiac segmentation, this paper presents the results of the Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation (M&Ms) Challenge, which was recently organized as part of the MICCAI 2020 Conference. A total of 14 teams submitted different solutions to the problem, combining various baseline models, data augmentation strategies, and domain adaptation techniques. The obtained results indicate the importance of intensity-driven data augmentation, as well as the need for further research to improve generalizability towards unseen scanner vendors or new imaging protocols. Furthermore, we present a new resource of 375 heterogeneous CMR datasets acquired by using four different scanner vendors in six hospitals and three different countries (Spain, Canada and Germany), which we provide as open-access for the community to enable future research in the field.A total of six clinical centres from Spain, Canada and Germany (numbered to 6 in this work) contributed to this III  AVERAGE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE IMAGES ACQUIRED IN THE DIFFERENT CENTRES challenge by providing a different number of CMR studies from different scanner vendors, as detailed in Table I . In total, 375 studies were included in this challenge. The subjects considered for this multi-disease study were selected among groups of various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, abnormal right ventricle, myocarditis and ischemic cardiomyopathy as well as healthy volunteers (see Table II for more details on the distribution of these cases). The specific scanner manufacturers are: 1) Siemens (Siemens Healthineers, Germany), 2) Philips (Philips Healthcare, Netherlands), 3) General Electric (GE, GE Healthcare, USA) and 4) Canon (Canon Inc., Japan). These four manufacturers were coded as A, B, C and D during the challenge, respectively. The CMR images derived from these four vendors are illustrated in Fig. 1 . More specific details on the studies are given in Table III .\nEvery CMR study was annotated manually by an expert clinician from the centre of origin, with experiences ranging from 3 to more than 10 years. Following the clinical protocol, short-axis views were annotated at the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases, as they correspond to the phases used to compute the relevant clinical biomarkers for cardiac diagnosis and follow-up. Three main regions were considered: the left and right ventricle (LV and RV, respectively) cavities and the left ventricle myocardium (MYO). In order to reduce the inter-observer and inter-centre variability in the contours, in particular at the apical and basal regions, a detailed revision of the provided segmentations was performed by four researchers in pairs. They applied the same SOP across all CMR datasets to obtain the final ground truth. To generate consistent annotations for the research community, we chose to apply the SOP that was already used by the ACDC challenge, as follows:\na) The LV and RV cavities must be completely covered, including the papillary muscles. b) No interpolation of the MYO boundaries must be performed at the basal region. c) The RV must have a larger surface at the ED time-frame compared to ES. d) The RV does not include the pulmonary artery. Clinical delineations as well as later corrections were performed using CVI42 software (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Alberta, Canada). All studies were provided in DICOM format and contours were extracted in cvi42 workspace format (.cvi42ws). An in-house software was then used to extract the contours and transform the images into the NIFTI format, representing the final files delivered to the challenge participants.\nAll participants in the challenge (except P11) used some form of data augmentation to enhance their models. Specifically, two families of data augmentations were considered: (1) spatial transformations to increase sample size through rotation, flipping, scaling or deformation of the original images; (2) intensity-driven techniques, which maintain the spatial configuration of the anatomical structures but modify their image appearance. The second type of augmentation seems particularly relevant for the M&Ms as it may increase the variability in image appearance, with the hypothesis that this may lead to improved adaptation to varying imaging protocols and scanner vendors. Two teams performed data augmentation using only spatial transformations (P4, P6). Eleven teams additionally implemented intensity-based transformations using one of two main approaches: (i) standard image transformations such as histogram matching, blurring, change in brightness, gamma and contrast, or addition of Gaussian noise (P1-P3, P7-P8, P10, P13) (see 3 for a visualization of a subset of these transformations on a training slice); (ii) advanced image synthesis by using generative adversarial networks (GANs) (P5, P8, P14) or variational auto-encoders (VAE) (P12). For the latter one, the generation of synthetic images for the unseen vendor D is not feasible since it was not included in the training. Note that the majority of the teams participating in the challenge (10 out of 14) relied solely on data augmentation of the training sample to address the domain-shift problem posed by the M&Ms challenge.\nAdditionally, some teams (P1-P3, P9, P13) applied testtime augmentation techniques, which consist of passing to the model two or more transformed versions of the same inference image to obtain several predictions. These predictions are then combined to obtain one final outcome, usually by averaging them. This method has been shown to improve the final performance in small data size scenarios and a net improvement with a scale effect that depends on the model architecture [38] .\nEnd context": "| Name | Size | Demographic information | Origin | Data or code link to find more |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| M&Ms Challenge | 375 studies | Various cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, abnormal right ventricle, myocarditis and ischemic cardiomyopathy as well as healthy volunteers | Spain, Canada and Germany | https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841520302676 |"}
