Hey everyone, I'm [Alex](https://x.com/_alexramalho) , the dev of askpaper. 

This askpaper initiative was part of my founding role in the Hippo AI Foundation, which unfortunately was terminated due to diverging values on transparency and communication.
I've developed it at my own cost, but the running costs were covered by the foundation. As it was cut, I no longer have the financial capacity to run it in a free way. As I have in the meantime embarked in other dev projects, I also don't have the time or the financial capacity to put in more work to fix it and improve it. 

There is still (some) hope though:
1. You can contribute here and change it accoringly.
2. I have created a [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/alexramalho) donation page with a target amount for me to step in, fix the bugs and change the subscription model to BYOK (bring your own key)
 
That's all, cheers!

if you're a dev and just here to see the code, feel free to roam around, but I can't help it to warn you that there's MANY things to improve around here.
